378126888	15063	1.0	de   e   oerhört   fula   och   filmen   bygger   bara   på   alla   fördommar   man   någonsin   skulle   kunna   ha   om   tjejer .  .  .    filmen   suger !

176246039	13002	3.5	i   enjoyed   the   movie   like   the   other   ones ,    but   sometimes   you   get   the   feeling   that   freddy   should   have   been   finished   long   ago ,    finishing   on   the   trilogy   of   nightmare   on   elm   street   would ['] ve   been   fine .

176246039	12870	4.5	what   a   superbly   crafted   movie .    the   subject   is   shocking   but   interesting   none   the   less .    powerhouse   performances   from   liam   neeson   and   ralph   fiennes    ( although   amon   was   very   under - used )    in   his   remarkably   evil   role ,    though   not   anywhere   near   as   evil   as   captain   byron   t .    hadley   from   the   shawshank   redemption .    absolutely   superb .
176246039	9049	5.0	every   once   in   a   while   you   will   find   yourself   asking   the   question    " why   haven ['] t   i   seen   this   before   now ?  "    and   this   has   definitely   been   the   case   after   seeing   the   fantastic   boogie   nights .    i   am   kicking   myself   that   i   hadn ['] t   seen   this   ages   before   now !       i   had   heard   mark   wahlberg ['] s   performance   was   amazing   and   everyone   who   told   me   that   hit   the   nail   square   on   the   head ;    he   shines   here   in   all   aspects .       there   isn ['] t   anything   i   didn ['] t   enjoy   about   boogie   nights ,    not   even   something   i   disliked   a   little .    i   was   a   little   reluctant   at   first   to   rent   it    ( because   of   the   backdrop )    but   you ['] re   missing   out   if   you   think   the   same   way   about   this .       every   performance   was   fantastic   throughout   the   course   of   boogie   nights   and   there   were   some   scenes   which   just   completely   came   out   of   nowhere   as   a   complete   shock ;    then   just   got   on   with   it   instead   of   dwelling .  .    very ,    very   well   done .       for   quite   some   time   i   lost   motivation   to   be   reviewing   movies   on   flixster .  .    i   am   glad   boogie   nights   has   put   me   back   on   track   because   it ['] s   just   that   damn   good .       do   yourself   a   favour   and   watch   this   asap .
176246039	7219	3.5	a   very   enjoyable   watch ,    but   sometimes   i   feel   people   are   not   saying   enough .    andy   garcia   hardly   says   anything   throughout   the   whole   movie ,    despite   being   a   survivor   at   the   end   which   was   surprising   aswell .    but   all   around   a   good   watch .
176246039	11173	3.5	it   twists   and   it   turns   maybe   too   many   times .    it ['] s   enjoyable   but   i   just   don ['] t   like   benicio   del   toro ,    his   presence   does   nothing   but   annoy   me   that   they   didn ['] t   cast   someone   better .
176246039	4109	5.0	there   is   absolutely   nothing   i   dislike   about   this   movie ,    everything   is   perfect .    i   feel   that   the   fantastic   80 ['] s   themed   soundtrack   deserves   a   mention   here   as   it   brings   the   movie   more   to   life   and   gets   you   more   involved   in   what   the   movie   is   all   about .       this   is   easily   one   of   my   favourite   movies   of   all   time   with   a   performance   from   christian   bale   which   is   very   close   to   his   best   as   the   fantastic   patrick   bateman .    the   supporting   cast   are   fantastic   aswell ,    particularly   josh   lucas   and   justin   theroux ,    and   even   bill   sage .       the   materialistic   impressions   of   wall   street   in   this   movie   are   hugely   arrogant   and   just   as   entertaining   and   psychopathic .    this   is   one   of   the   most   quotable   movies   from   all   time   with   a   number   of   highly   entertaining   speeches   and   some   amazing   diverse   acting .       this   movie   will   never   be   rated   less   than   5 / 5   from   me .
176246039	9818	4.0	very   good   stuff ,    great   performances   from   kevin   spacey ,    russel   crowe   and   numerous   others   of   the   cast .    not   the   best   movie   i   have   seen   but   a   very   decent   stab   at   it .    it ['] s   very   gritty   at   stages   and   fairly   violent   but   it   works   well   and   definetly   worth   watching .
176246039	631	4.5	i   was   impressed ,    very   impressed .    very   good   to   see   some   fresh   fight   scenes ,    the   type   that   never   get   old .    this   movie   proves   that   jet - li   can   act   and   is   capable   of   doing   such   amazing   fights   with   no   strings   attached .    nice   to   see   alot   of   it   done   in   scotland   aswell   which   was   the   icing   on   this   already   fantastic   cake .
176246039	3864	5.0	i ['] d   been   waiting   years   to   see   a   batman   movie   as   accurate   and   mindblowing   as   this   one ;    and   they   couldn ['] t   have   handpicked   the   cast   any   better   with   the   exception   of   katie   holmes   possibly .       everything   about   it   surpassed   anything   put   in   a   batman   movie   before   and   this   is   why   this   is   in   an   entire   league   of   its   own .    the   production   team   here   know   exactly   what   we   batfan ['] s   want   and   they   do   more   than   just   deliver   here   in   this   masterpiece .       every   aspect   of   the   movie   was   fantastic ,    and   i ['] m   so   glad   it   wasn ['] t   another    " throw   some   instant   crotch   shots   in   the   first   15   seconds   with   no   explanation   of   why   he   is   batman "    movie .       i ['] d   seen   christian   bale   in   the   machinist   before   this   and   the   thing   that   had   me   hooked   on   what   i ['] d   seen   was   his   dedication   to   what   has   to   be   done .    if   you   look   at   the   size   of   him   in   the   machinist   and   then   the   size   of   him   in   batman   begins ,    that ['] s   only   a   small   taste   of   his   dedication .       this   is   the   best   batman   movie   of   all   time   and   my   favourite   movie   of   all   time ,    and   i      have   nothing   but   immensely   high   hopes   for   the   sequel    " the   dark   knight "    in   2008 .
176246039	9265	4.5	equally   as   fantastic   as   the   first   movie   in   tim   burtons   creation   of   batman   movies .    this   one   you   can   clearly   see   the   tim   burton   influence   coming   through   with   the   whole   christmas   thing .    a   few   stronger   actors   in   this   including   christopher   walken   and   danny   devito ,    another   of   my   favourites   which   i   have   loved   for   as   long   as   i   can   remember .

782710398	15853	4.0	what   can   i   say ?    i   love   those   zombie   killing   films !    resident   evil   actually   came   extremely   close   to   disproving   the   old   video   game   into   movie   theory   but   it   slips   up   every   now   and   again .
782710398	8072	5.0	a   great   film   for   those   that   love   crime   thrillers   with   a   psychotic   twist .    you   may   not   have   the   stomach   to   watch   it   for   awhile   after   having   sat   through   it   once ,    but   make   no   mistake    -    this   is   an   amazing   work   of   art .
782710398	10168	2.5	not   as   good   as   i   expected   it   to   be    -    on   kind   of   the   same   level   as   you   would   file   hellboy   and   other    " ok "    comic   book   films .

782710398	4384	4.0	snyder   delivers   a   worthy   remake   of   a   zombie   cult   classic ,    but   this   one   has   better   looking   gore   and   death .  .  .
782710398	7057	4.5	jackson   delivers   an   equally   amazing   continuation   to   the   fellowship   of   the   ring .    this   time   we   get   to   see   more   of   middle   earth   and   its   inhabitants ,    plus   the   battle   of   helms   deep    ( which   is   still   up   there   in   my   most   favorite   war   scenes )  .

782710398	10358	3.0	i   think   i   saw   this   movie .  .  . don ['] t   remember   if   i   liked   it   or   not    -    if   i   can ['] t   remember   than   it   wasn ['] t   that   memorable   was   it ?
782710398	2782	4.5	it ['] s   length   really   works   against   gibson ['] s   epic   here   but   overall   braveheart   is   your   go   to   movie   for   some   medieval   ass   kicking .
782710398	9442	3.0	surprisingly   an   entertaining   sci - fi   action   flick .    although   somewhat   nothing   like   pitch   black ,    chronicles   lets   you   explore   the   franchise ['] s   universe   more :    think   of   that   universe   as   star   wars   meets   dune   and   stargate
782710398	4043	3.5	shyamalan   delivers   a   story   that   somehow   effectively   mixes   an   alien   invasion   with   finding   christ   again .  .  . and   somehow ,    just   somehow ,    it   ends   up   being   an   entertaining   sci - fi   thriller .
782710398	3427	2.5	while   men   in   black   ii   can   be   lumped   in   there   with   other   half - assed   sci - fi   action   flicks    ( usually   starring   will   smith )    there ['] s   no   doubt   that   this   film   will   entertain   those   that   come   across   it   on   tbs   during   a   crappy   day .
782710398	5939	3.0	like   most   action   movie   sequels ,    returns   tries   to   trump   the   original   with   better   cg ,    more   action ,    and   less   thought .    returns   is   an   effective   mummy / action   flick   but   some   of   the   enjoyment   of   the   first   film   is   lost .
782710398	1865	4.5	a   thought - provoking   and   very   emotional   film   for   me ,    this   film   says   alot   about   love .
782710398	10275	2.0	just   another    " american   pie "    for   the   early   2000s ,    but   with   less   fans   and   even   less   interesting   content .

782710398	16879	1.5	there ['] s   so   many   negative   things   to   say   about   the   ol [']    titanic .    this   is   where   my   hate   for   leo   began .    in   my   opinion   the   best   part   of   the   movie   remains   the   end    ( where   the   ship   sinks )  ,    it ['] s   just   too   bad   it   almost   takes   4   hours   to   get   there .  .  .
782710398	5448	3.0	just   like   watching   episodes   of   the   show   on   mtv   back   to   back ,    only   without   bleeps   and   fuzzy   censorship   bubbles .
782710398	7032	3.0	austin   isn ['] t   as   funny   this   third   time   around   and   i ['] m   thankful   they   never   made   a   fourth    ( yet .  .  .  )  .    while   powers [']     " charm "    and    " grooviness "    made   us   laugh   the   first   time   and   giggle   the   second ,    goldmember   relies   more   on   other   characters   to   carry   the   comedy .
782710398	4551	5.0	i   total   riot !    if   you   like   english   gangster   movies   with   a   comedic   twist   you ['] ll   not   want   to   miss   snatch .
782710398	2689	4.5	i   can ['] t   express   how   blown   back   i   was   after   seeing   this   movie .    a   futuristic   sci - fi   thriller   that   touches   many   different   nerves   and   delivers   something   totally   original .
782710398	9882	3.0	an   interesting   sci - fi   thriller .  .  . it ['] s   cartoony   and   fun   for   the   whole   ride   through .
782710398	11152	5.0	quite   possibly   one   of   the   most   important   movies   to   come   out   in   a   long   time .    there ['] s   something   about   american   history   x   that   i   love   so   much .    norton   quite   possibly   delivers   a   performance   far   greater   than   anything   he ['] s   ever   done   before   and   i   would ['] ve   given   him   the   oscar   that   year !
782710398	9645	0.5	not   even   my   liking   of   eddie   murphy   could   bring   any   sort   of   enjoyment   to   this   film .

245368054	4472	1.0	women   like   it   but   lets   face   it   the   acting   leaves   a   lot   to   be   desired   and   your   typical   predictable   chick   flick

802021589	11999	4.5	hahaha   this   was   a   fuuunny   movvie   but   at   the   same   time   is   was   odd .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
785811477	205	2.5	not   too   impressed   with   the   performance   of   brad   and   co .  .  .    and   better   skip   this   one    .  .  .
785811477	6037	4.0	this   film   has   upt   the   level   of   all   spy   flicks .  .  .    i   even   think   casino   royale   has   taken   the   inspiration   from   this   one .  .  .
785811477	5401	3.0	totally   stupid   and   hillarious .  .  .    but   that ['] s   probably   all   ben   stiller   movies .
785811477	8904	4.5	loved   this   movie   a   lot .    powerful   performance   from   both   matt   and   robin .
785811477	10730	4.0	couldn ['] t   forget   this   one .  .  .    saw   it   in   a   tourbus   in   new   york ,    where   we   passed   the   5   points .  .  .  .    daniel   day - lewis   was   superbe   in   his   rol   as   bill   the   butcher .
785811477	4640	4.5	loved   the   casino   scene .  .  .    and   dustin   made   a   huge   impression   as   raymond .
785811477	798	4.0	a   must   see   movie .  .  .    the   first   flick   that   made   everyone   affraid   to   swim   in   the   sea .  .  .    one   of   the   most   famous   tunes   in   movie   history .
785811477	2743	4.5	def   a   must   see   movie .    adrien   played   a   superbe   rol   as   a   polish   composer .    although   it   happens   in   one   of   the   darkest   times   in   history ,    the   film   graps   your   heart   with   sadness   and   happiness   at   the   same   time .
785811477	3713	3.0	this   movie   was   being   forced   to   watch   by   some   friends   last   night .  .  .    and   it   actually   turn   out   to   be   quite   a   suprise .    i ['] ve   never   been   a   fan   of   this   type   of   movie   and   always   had   the   prejudice   that   saw   was   a    " gore "    movie ,       cheap   b   movie .  .  .    but   the   plot   was   actually   quite   original .  .    in   a   way .    well   done .  .  .
785811477	10820	5.0	this   movie   had      one      of   the   coolest   cars   in   movie   history .  .  .    and   the   back   in   time   thing   was   hilarious   during   certain   scenes .    a   classic   comedy ,    a   must   see   movie !
785811477	10344	3.0	don ['] t   know   why ,    but   back   than   this   movie   was   quite   funny ,    with   all   those   crazy   aussie ['] s   from   the   walkabout   creek .
785811477	9298	3.5	i   didn ['] t   had   a   clue   at   first   what   to   expect ,    but   when   the   film   progressed .  .  .    it   turn   out   to   be   one   funny   horror   movie .  .  .
785811477	14218	3.5	it ['] s   always   nice   to   have   fans .  .  .    but   just   watch   how   far   a   number   one   fan   will   do   to   put   his   favorite   writer   at    " ease "  .  .  .    brilliant   performance   from   kathy   bates .
785811477	4306	3.0	the   film   was   a   lesse   experience   than   for   most   of   the   people   i   knew ,    as   i   thought   it   was   quite   predictable .  .  .    but   none   of   the   less .  .  .    a   very   intelligent   ghost   story .
658764869	12130	5.0	what   can   i   write .
658764869	15233	1.0	stiller ,    ferrell   and   owen   wilson ,    to   me   this   is   as   appealing   as   hitler ,    stalin   and   pol   pot   hacking   blind   orphanes   to   death .
658764869	7767	4.5	coen ['] s   brilliance   once   again   on   show ,    in   a   really   funny   version   of   homer ['] s   the   odyssey .
658764869	10583	3.5	good   not   great
658764869	5363	3.0	don ['] t   cast   affleck   and   ferrell .
658764869	1176	5.0	a   companion   piece   to   pan ['] s   labyrinth ,    i   loved   this   and   we   should   all   see   it .
658764869	9298	2.0	the   first   half   of   this   film   i   was   actually   enjoying ,    surprisingly ,    then   they   decide   to   throw   in   vampires ,    brilliant   that   really   helps   add   depth   to   the   film ,    morons .
658764869	10774	5.0	for   me   this   film   is   what   a   movie   should   be ,    dramatic   and   beautiful   while   also   provoking   an   idea   inside   the   viewer ['] s   mind .    de   niro ['] s   performance   as   the   warped   and   disillusioned   sociopath   travis   bickle   is   incredible   and   shows   that   he   is   the   greatest   acting   talent   of   all   time .    the   depth   that   he   gives   the   character   means   that   we   do   not   hate   travis   even   though   he   is   one   of   the   most   dislikeable   characters   ever   created   on   paper .    the   relatively   small   supporting   cast   also   put   in   great   performances .    jodie   foster ['] s   character   is   acted   out   to   perfection ,    and   this   alone   makes   it   great .    however   everything   else   done   to   the   film   is   brilliant   as   well ,    martin   scorsese ['] s   directing   presents   the   story   and   guides   us   along   with   it   subtly   and   not   simply   explaining   it .    he   also   manages   to   emphasise   impressively   travis [']    isolation   and   almost   justify   his   thoughts   and   actions   with   our   view   of   new   york   as   a   venal   hell .    the   soundtrack   is   also   brilliant   with   bernard   herrman   providing   a   jazz   like   set   which   layers   travis [']    view   of   new   york   with   even   more   disgust   for   this   nihilistic   city .    this   film   for   me   is   perfect   and   cannot   be   beaten   and   makes   it   my   favourite   film .
658764869	7193	2.0	really   overarted ,    not   that   funny   apart   from   odd   moments   with   christopher   guest   or   peter   cook .    really   not   good .
658764869	12293	5.0	i   don ['] t   need   to   comment   on   this   film   or   the   sequal .
658764869	14550	5.0	iam   not   totally   convinced   by   the   shawshank   redemption .    i   can   watch   it   and   be   disgusted   by   its   sentimentality ,    and   watch   the   next   day   and   be   really   moved   i   just   don ['] t   know .    oh   well   i   should   be   postitive .
658764869	14671	5.0	a   perfect   piece   of   cinema   with   everything   going   right   to   produce   an   increadible   account   of   the   final   days   of   the   third   reich .
658764869	11022	3.0	this ,    was   ok ,    but   as   usaul ,    it   is   a   partizan   documentary ,    and   one   that   leaves   out   valuable   pieces   of   information   to   bias   the   story .    quite   good   though .
658764869	12690	4.0	fantastic   visuals .    really   brilliant   film .
658764869	10662	5.0	arguably   the   greatest   anime   ever ,    and   while   i   do   see   the   argument   for   it ,    my   personal   preference   is   spirited   away .    but   it   is   still   a   masterpiece ,    that   is   brutal ,    thought   provoking   and   perfect   cinema .
658764869	13302	4.0	if   you   have   any   conservative   thoughts   on   race   censorship   and   taste ,    you   will   hate   this   film   but ,    this   is   a   masterpiece   of   comedy   and   the   fact   it   has   no   plot   synopsis   on   flixster   really   says   a   lot .
658764869	14725	1.5	dont   like   the   franchise .    lets   just   say   i   have   a   mole   on   my   face ,    lots   of   friendly   comments   after   all   these   films .

658764869	3106	1.5	laughable
658764869	5515	5.0	you   have   to   watch   this ,    it   may   have   dated   in   terms   of   its   comic   appeal ,    but   overall   it   reamains   powerful   and   is   poignant   today   43   years   later .
658764869	15425	5.0	a   brilliant   and   abstract   comedy

840198523	5571	5.0	still   the   best   of   the   rocky   movies .    the   last   one   was   better   than   expected   though .

591377321	11337	4.0	brilliant !  !       how   can   people   not   find   this   funny
591377321	3938	4.0	not   normally   my   type   of   film   but   even   i   could   start   watching   cartoon   films   if   they   were   all   as   good   as   this !
591377321	14618	2.5	hmm ,    not   as   good   as   what   people   made   out
189402067	3962	4.0	as   a   kid   friendly   flick   goes ,    and   as   much   as   its   not   my   thing ,    i   have   to   admit   its   pretty   good .
189402067	2985	3.0	average
189402067	15107	3.5	good ,    but   not   spectacular .  .  .    i   prefered   the   original .
189402067	3864	4.0	great   movie ,    it   was   good   all   around ,    even   as      a   make   out   movie .    best   of   the   batmans   by   far
189402067	14103	0.5	boring .  .  .  .
189402067	12471	0.5	m   and   m   is   a   wigger   tool .    this   is   about   the   same   as   that   shitty   50cent   flick .  .  .    rapper   self - glorification .    maybe   if   they   actually   played   instruments ,    i   would   give   them   some    " respect "  .
7941657	17133	2.5	its   quite   scary   how   i   remember   this   on   the   lovely   days   of   the   vhs .       i   used   to   adore   this   when   i   was   younger ,    i   havent   seen   it   for   a   good   5   years   but   still   from   what   i   can   remember   and   what   i   thought   of   it   last   time   i   say   it ,    it   deserves   the   rating   i ['] ll   give   it .
7941657	6037	3.5	took   a   while   for   me   to   get   around   to   watching   it ,    but   i   rather   enjoyed   it .
7941657	15105	4.0	i   watched   bits   of   this   with   my   girlfriend   whilst   doing   the   ironing ,    it   looked   like   a   very   good   film .  .  .
7941657	4043	2.0	i   bit   bland   really .
7941657	3638	3.5	its   almost   as   good   as   the   original ,    they   tried ,    ile   give   them   credit   for   that   at   least .       it   could   have   only   gone   insanely   wrong   with   the   sequal ,    but   i   dont   think   it   did .  .  . a   pleasent   surprise .
7941657	10928	4.0	its   jim   carrey ,    of   course   this   film   was   gonna   be   good
7941657	11663	4.5	the   first ,    and   for   the   change   is   debatable   whether   its   the   best .  .  . that ['] s   not   a   very   common   thing   in   today ['] s   movie   releases .       regardless   its   a   great   start   to   the   already   hugely   popular   set   of   films .  .  . i   dont   think   there   will   be   a   time   when   they   run   out   of   ideas   for   a   final   destination   film .  .  .  .  . 10   of   them ,    maybe ?    lol
7941657	3333	3.0	bit   of   a   shame ,    i   liked   the   twist   at   the   end   as   i   really   didn ['] t   see   it   coming ,    i   wasn ['] t   expecting   a   twist   at   all   really . great   plot ,    just   really   inst   for   enjoyable   film   watching .
7941657	12238	0.5	i   started   the   first   20   mins   only   to   turn   it   off .  .  . utter   c *  * p   it   was .
7941657	11850	0.5	this   is   an   offense   to   the   original .       poxy   american   humour ,    why ?  !       its   not   funny !
7941657	15945	4.0	i   used   to   love   this ,    so   on   that   note .  .  . i   rated   it   quite   high .
7941657	9756	0.5	it   wasn ['] t   funny ,    it   wasn ['] t   entertaining ,    it   wasn ['] t   anything   apart   from   rubbish .
7941657	4829	4.0	its   an   odd   film   that   works ,    funny   in   places   you   wouldnt   expect   and   the   story   line   is   rather   good   too .  .  .
7941657	13056	3.0	not   a   bad   film ,    i   wasn ['] t   blown   away   however .
7941657	16242	4.5	a   very   well   created   film ,    great   acting ,    great   storyline .  .  .  .  . great   everything   basically .       one   of   my   top   films ,    worthy   of   a   watch   by   anyone .
7941657	13707	4.0	i   highly   satisfying   film ,    my   mate   used   to   mention   this   everyday   back   in   my   school   days .       it   was   him   who   got   me   to   watch   it   the   first   time ,    and   i   think   him   for   that   lol .
7941657	2690	3.0	it   wasnt   anything   special ,    but   it   wasnt   too   bad
7941657	6971	1.0	i   think   i   remember   seeing   this ,    and   i   found   it   crap .

60809906	2913	3.5	johnny   depp   is   wonderful ,    as   ever .    i   hadn ['] t   previously   realised   how   much   kate   winslet   can   remind   me   of   julie   andrews   in   full - on   mary   poppins   mode .    there ['] s   not   really   much   plot ,    and   it ['] s   all   a   bit   obvious   in   place    ( she   coughs   significantly ,    therefore   she ['] s   gonna   die )    but   generally   watchable .
60809906	2465	5.0	painfully   accurately   observed ,    and   very   very   funny .     ['] it ['] s   not   a   big   college   town [']     -    priceless .
60809906	3533	3.0	next   time   some   supposedly   intelligent   thirty -    or   forty - something   tells   me   i   have   to   see    ['] the   bit   where   the   puppets   have   sex   cos   it ['] s   the   funniest   thing   ever [']  ,    i   think   i ['] ll   spew .    some   funny   bits ,    some   crass   bits ,    would   have   been   better   with   a   sharper   and   more   focused   satirical   edge .    reminds   me   of   mel   brooks   movies   in   that   way .
60809906	3938	4.0	good ,    but   not   as   good   as   the   first   one ,    nor   as   good   as   most   of   pixar ['] s   output .    will   date   quickly ,    methinks .
60809906	15953	3.0	funny - ish .    some   nice   nods   to   genre   sci - fi   conventions ,    but   nothing   special .
60809906	14670	3.0	not   tim   burton ['] s   worst ,    but   not   as   good   as   it   should   have   been .    i   wouldn ['] t      want   to   see   it   again .
60809906	11696	4.0	this   is   funny   because   it   is   a   very   accurate   parody   of   all   that ['] s   ridiculous   about   tv   sci - fi .    but   it ['] s   not   just   a   string   of   jokes :    it   has   a   story   and   characters   all   of   its   own .

60809906	7664	4.0	actually   rather   good .    crowe   does    ['] quiet   spoken   man   of   honour   on   a   mission [']    pretty   well ,    and   the   visuals   are   great .

60809906	4056	1.0	hopeless .    the   usually   great   tim   burton   gets   completely   lost   in   a   labyrinth   of   bad   acting ,    plot   holes   big   enough   for   a   herd   of   wild   horses   to   stampede   through   and   the   worst   twist   ending   ever .    one   redeeming   feature :    helena   bonham   carter   is   cute   in   a   chimp   suit    -    rawr .
60809906	7509	2.0	pierce   brosnan   started   so   well    -    goldeneye   was   the   best   bond   since   connery    -    but   this   is   a   mess   with   no   real   plot   and ,    unforgiveably ,    really   cheap   looking   sfx .    a   sad   farewell   to   the   second   best   bond .
60809906	3446	5.0	utter   genius .
60809906	2430	4.0	the   prototype   of   all   sci - fi   horror ,    and   still   the   best .

759272928	15582	1.5	ugh ,    chick   flick
759272928	28	4.0	great   artwork .    and   i   honestly   think   everything   about   it   was   good .
785621036	2580	3.0	i   enjoyed   this .    it ['] s   not   intended   to   be   one   of   the   great   all - time   classics ,    but   i   think   it   achieves   what   it   sets   out   to   do ;    it ['] s   a   fun   way   to   spend   a   couple   of   hours .    the   cast   do   a   good   job ,    and   i   particularly   liked   the   well - timed   rugby   tackles .
785621036	16390	3.0	this   is   one   of   those   films   where   they   spend   the   first   half   hour   establishing   the   premise ,    although   you   probably   already   know   what   it   is    ( e . g .    from   the   trailer )  .    so ,    a   bit   of   a   slow   start ,    but   it ['] s   quite   tense   after   that .    i   probably   won ['] t   watch   it   again    ( now   that   i   know   what   happens )  ,    but   it   kept   my   attention .
785621036	17169	3.5	a   lot   of   fun ,    if   you   can   accept   that   it ['] s   fiction ,    and   therefore   not   historically   accurate .
785621036	5020	3.5	i   enjoyed   this :    it   made   me   laugh ,    and   there   was   a   nice   cameo   from   bond    ( string   quartet )  .
785621036	3287	3.5	in   brief ,    i   thought   that   this   was   a   good   film .    however ,    i ['] ve   found   lately   that   i ['] m   more   interested   in   plot / characterisation   than   i   am   in   fight   scenes .    i   still   like   action ,    but   i   prefer   rescues .       i   thought   this   film   had   a   good   plot ,    that   built   strongly   on   the   events   of   the   first   two   films .    and    ( for   once )    i   can   say   that   the   female   nudity   wasn ['] t   gratuitous ,    given   that   the   three   male   actors   portraying   time - travellers   took   their   turn   in   the   previous   films .    however ,    there   was   a   shift   towards   comedy   here ,    and   while   i   found   those   scenes   funny ,    i ['] m   not   sure   that   this   is   the   best   direction   to   take .
785621036	3254	3.5	i   liked   this .    i   would   say   that   this   film   is   to    " spider - man "    as    " angel "    is   to    " buffy "     -    a   bit   darker ,    and   more   mature .    they ['] ve   made   various   changes   from   the   comics    -    most   of   them   i   agreed   with ,    it ['] s   just   one   or   two   that   i   didn ['] t .    and   i   really   liked   the   way   they   handled   his   hyper - senses .    key   tip :    there ['] s   an   extra   scene   in   the   middle   of   the   end   credits .
785621036	14940	2.0	this   was   ok ,    but   not   worth   paying   money   for .    it   took   a   while   to   get   going ,    but   there   were   some   funny   scenes ,    and   some   surprisingly   profound   advice .    overall ,    it ['] s   a   bit   like    " the   goonies "  ,    but   with   older   characters .
785621036	11123	3.0	it   was   fun ,    and   the   adult   characters   were   handled   fairly   well    -    although   they   were   sidelined ,    this   was   due   to   them   being   busy   rather   than   incompetent .       admittedly ,    there   were   a   few   bits   of   expository   dialogue   that   were   very   clunky    (  " my   god ,    it ['] s   x ,    the   trusty   manservant   of   jeff   wayne ,    the   billionaire   former   astronaut   whose   wife   died   in   a   skiing   accident   three   years   ago !  "  )  .    they   reminded   me   of   sluggy ,    with   its    " recap   in   one   breath "    moments .    still ,    i ['] ll   forgive   them   a   lot ,    just   to   see   the   machines   in   live - action ,    which   i   thought   were   very   cool .
785621036	16339	3.5	quite   fun ,    with   some   sweet   bits .    however ,    avoid   watching   it   on   tv ,    because   they   cut    " unsuitable "    bits   out   of   it   which   makes   it   disjointed .
785621036	14215	3.0	this   was   pretty   nifty .    i   used   to   watch   the   old   black   and   white   serials   like    " king   of   the   rocket   men !  "    when   i   was   a   kid ,    so   there ['] s   a   definite   nostalgia   factor .    at   the   same   time ,    it   wasn ['] t   as   blatantly   silly   as   the   captain   proton   episode   of   voyager    ( which   i   also   enjoyed ,    but   in   a   different   way )  .
785621036	6860	3.0	it ['] s   an   interesting   film ,    although   it ['] s   not   quite   what   i ['] d   expected   from   the   trailer ;    it ['] s   thoughtful   rather   than   funny .    a   good   cast   and   picturesque   scenery .
785621036	5363	2.0	i ['] m   glad   i   watched   this ,    just   to    " complete   the   set "  ,    but   i   wasn ['] t   very   impressed   by   it .    there   were   a   few   funny   parts ,    and   a   good   performance   from   eliza   dushku ,    but   i   don ['] t   think   it ['] s   as   clever   as   it   thinks   it   is .    mind   you ,    i   do   recognise   the   irony   in   me   criticising   it   on   the   internet .
785621036	528	2.5	i   thought   this   was   alright .    i   realise   that   i   might   be   damning   with   faint   praise   here ,    but   i ['] ve   never   been   a   rabid   fan   of   the   series ;    i   mainly   know   it   through   the   books ,    which   i   liked ,    but   i ['] ve   always   thought   of   them   as   amusing   rather   than   uproariously   funny .    the   things   that   have   mainly   stuck   in   my   head   over   the   years   are   the   quirky   concepts   like   the   three   space   arks .    that   said ,    lots   of   the   people   around   me   were   laughing   a   lot   more   than   me ,    so   i   don ['] t   think   that ['] s   a   bad   reflection   on   the   film ,    just   different   senses   of   humour .       as   for   the   changes ,    i   don ['] t   object   to   them ;    the   only   thing   i   was   a   bit   disappointed   by   was    " beware   of   the   leopard "  .    i   wasn ['] t   sure   about   the   dolphin   song   at   first ,    but   it   turned   out   to   be   quite   catchy    ( in   a    " stuck   in   your   head "    way )  ,    so   i ['] m   happy   with   that .       my   only   real   criticism   was   that   there   were   a   couple   of   sub - plots   that   didn ['] t   go   anywhere .    i   gather   that   there   will   be   lots   of   deleted   scenes   on   the   dvd ,    which   is   fair   enough ,    but   i ['] d   rather   that   the   film   had   been   re - edited   to   chop   them   out   altogether ,    rather   than   leaving   the   dangling   threads .    still ,    all   in   all ,    it   was   worth   watching .       finally ,    one   piece   of   advice    -    do   stick   around   for   the   credits    ( there ['] s   an   extra   scene   in   the   middle )  .
785621036	3624	3.5	i   thought   this   was   very   interesting ,    well   acted ,    and   with   interesting   points   about   japanese   history .
785621036	13248	4.0	this   is   a   vastly   underrated   film ,    with   some   clever   observations   on   the   nature   of   reality .    it   has   plenty   of   funny   lines ,    along   with   some   moving   scenes   and   action   pieces .    this   film   motivated   me   to   go   out   and   buy   a   mozart   album .
785621036	17762	3.0	this   is   an   intelligent   film ,    which   raises   some   interesting   questions .    mind   you ,    you   should   avoid   the   trailer ,    which   simultaneously   manages   to   give   away   key   plot   points   while   completely   misrepresenting   the   type   of   film   it   is .    it   reminded   me   of   the   trailer   for   the   original    " star   trek "    film ,    which   desperately   tries   to   make   a   cerebral   plotline   sound   action   packed .
785621036	3860	2.0	this   was   ok ,    but   nothing   special .    i   liked   the   basic   theme   involved    ( the   need   to   accept   personal   responsibility )  ,    but   i   think   that    " dungeons   and   dragons "     ( the   animated   series )    did   it   better .
785621036	758	3.0	this   film   wasn ['] t   what   i   was   expecting   at   all ,    and   it   turned   out   to   be   surprisingly   good .    there   was   a   decent   plot ,    with   some   very   funny   moments ,    and   the   cast   did   a   good   job    ( particularly   neil   flynn   in   a   small   role )  .    actually ,    it   reminded   me   of    " can ['] t   buy   me   love "  ,    so   if   you   liked   one   of   them   then   i ['] d   recommend   the   other .       as   for   the   maths   in   the   film ,    that ['] s   the   stuff   i   got   stuck   on   at   degree   level ,    so   i ['] m   very   impressed   that   they   were   doing   it   in   high   school !
785621036	16178	4.0	i   first   saw   this   film   when   i   was   a   kid ,    but   i ['] m   very   happy   to   rewatch   it .    while   other   incarnations   of   batman   focus   on   the    " dark   avenger "    aspects   of   the   character ,    this   one   goes   for   inspired   lunacy .     (  " the   crime   happened   at   sea    .  .  .    c    .  .  .    catwoman   must   be   involved !  "  )    mind   you ,    looking   at   it   now ,    i   suspect   that   robin   would   fit   in   quite   well   with   the   power   rangers ,    since   he ['] s   so   keen   on   dramatic   movements ,    particularly   punching   his   right   fist   into   his   left   palm .    then   again ,    i   think   this   may   be   the   only   batman   film   so   far   where   he   doesn ['] t   reveal   his   secret   identity   to   his   girlfriend   by   the   end   of   the   film ,    so   in   that   sense   it ['] s   closer   to   the   comics   than   the    " serious "    films .    anyway ,    it ['] s   a   lot   of   fun ,    and   probably   the   best   use   of   a    " trained   exploding   shark "    i ['] ve   ever   seen .
785621036	2095	3.5	i   enjoyed   this :    it   has   a   lot   of   slapstick   comedy   that   made   me   laugh ,    but   there   are   also   some   surprisingly   moving   scenes .    if   you   liked   the    " what ['] s   my   fruit ?  "    scene   in   red   dwarf ,    you ['] ll   probably   like   this   too .       however ,    best   to   watch   it   on   dvd   rather   than   on   tv ,    because   there ['] s   some   clumsy   editing .    i   don ['] t   think   that   the    " offensive "    content   was   integral   to   the   plot ,    but   it ['] s   a   bit   jarring   when   they   cut   the   end   of   someone ['] s   sentence ,    or   the   voices   blatantly   don ['] t   match   the   lip   movements .
785621036	6971	3.5	very   much   an   80s   film    ( some   bits   seem   quite   dated   now )  ,    but   it ['] s   entertaining .
785621036	10466	1.5	it   had   some   good   bits ,    and   it ['] s   interesting   from   a   historical   perspective ,    but   i   found   it   pretty   dull .

501072912	11745	4.5	although   critics   didn ['] t   like   this   movie ,    i   find   it   very   good ,    scenes   are   magnificent ,    jennifer   looks   sexier   than   ever   and   the   plot   is   okay ,    not   so   complicated   but   fluent .    what   can   you   expect   of   a   comic   book ,    anyway ?    way   better   then   that   stupid   daredevil .

437853017	4266	2.0	the   only   thing   mildy   interesting   or   gripping   in   this   film   is   wondering   whether   or   not   jesus   really   did   invent   tall   tables .  .  .
437853017	11648	3.0	i   actually   loved   this   film   first   time   i   saw   it . what   eight   year   old   couldnt   with   kenan    &    kel   at   the   helm

437853017	312	4.0	great   book .       even   better   film
437853017	15890	1.0	the   pitch   of   this   film   prob   went   thusly :  " i   know !       a   group   of   friends   set   out   on   a   massive   journey   across   the   country "  " meh ,    it ['] s   been   done "  " but   has   it   been   done   with   a   toaster ?

437853017	10583	4.0	jack   black   gives   a   great   performance .       the   soundtracks   not   half - bad   either .
437853017	2594	0.5	i   see   this   film   recieved    " two   thumbs   up "  . what   they   fail   to   point   out   is   that   the   thumbs   are   those   of   a   man   who   lost   all   eight   of   his   fingers   in   an   accident   and   was ,    indeed ,    attempting   to   make   the    " wanker "    sign   with   both   hands   towards   the   producers
437853017	10282	2.5	i   used   to   think   that   this   was   the   single   greatest   thing   ever   committed   to   film .       not   so   much   now
437853017	3079	4.5	probably   the   only   disney   movie   not   involving   pixar   that   you   should   spend   anything   more   than   a   fiver   on
12848633	6099	4.5	there ['] s   something   different   about   the   vietnam   war ,    as   opposed   to   other   wars   of   the   same   period ,    like   say ,    wwii   or   korea .    speaking   as   a   pacifist ,    all   were   terrible ,    but   it   seems   like   in   vietnam   human   nature   really   reached   rock   bottom .    the   draftees   sent   in   by   the   usa ,    many   of   them   17   or   18   years   old ,    committed   so   many   true   atrocieties   that   only   a   handful   of   the   worst   are   remembered .    maybe   that ['] s   what   makes   apocalypse   now   so   believable ,    that   dispite   the   unlikelihood   of   kurtz ['] s   madness ,    it ['] s   not   that   far   from   things   that   really   happened .    also ,    the   way   this   film   has   seeped   into   our   unconscious   is   astonishing .     " charlie   don ['] t   surf .  "    outstanding   film .
12848633	12224	3.5	only   slightly   less   good   than   scream ,    not   even   enough   to   justify   a   half - star .
12848633	14869	3.0	having   read   the   phillip   k   dick   book   it   was   based   on   i ['] d   have   to   say   this   is   not   only   a   good   representation   of   the   story ,    it   also   kind   of   improves   it .    while   some   of   the   more   endeering   finer   details   were   left   out    ( like   the   whole   thing   about   the   sheep )    i   preferred   the   story   without   the   mercer - trip   thing .    but   then   again   i   find   it   impossible   to   stay   awake   til   the   end   of   this   film ,    so   maybe   i ['] m   wrong   and   it   was   all   left   in .     * shrugs *    also   i ['] m   not   in   100 %    agreement   with   storylines   being   altered   to   make   films ,    but   given   that   being   hollywood   it   had   to   happen   i   don ['] t   think   the   film   really   suffered .
12848633	10429	3.0	better   than   the   first   one   but   again   not   scary .
12848633	6196	3.5	looking   a   bit   dated   nowadays   but   still   the   classic   action   scifi .    brilliant   film ,    what   can   i   say ?
12848633	2782	3.0	a   good   yarn ,    but   has   little   to   do   with   william   wallace   as   a   real   historical   figure .    he   was   executed   long   before   edward   i   and   don ['] t   quote   me   but   i   think   the   romance   thing   is   total   hollywood   fabrication .
12848633	13860	1.5	my   parents   are   still   watching   this   downstairs ,    but   i ['] ve   walked .    the   characterisation   is   so   crap ,    most   noticably   in   the   daughter   character ,    who   is   about   18   and   yet   is   going   around   with   a   teddy   bear   under   one   arm   saying   stuff   like    " daddy   i ['] m   scared "    and   generally   acting   like   a   9   year   old .    i   can ['] t   take   it .
12848633	3290	4.5	pretty   damn   good ,    as   it   doesn ['] t   follow   the    " sequel   is   always   shit "    rule    :  )
12848633	17479	4.5	i   preferred   this   to   ringu   because   it   ties   up   the   plot   a   lot   better   and   has   much   better   effects .    and   i   love   the   way   you   think   it ['] s   a   happy   ending ,    and   then   it   dawns   on   you .  .  .
12848633	11929	2.5	pretty   cool   but   not   scary .
12848633	16912	3.0	better   than   any   of   the   crap   churned   out   by   disney ,    but   still   nowhere   near   nick   park ['] s   inspired   wallace   and   gromit   films .
12848633	9426	4.5	right   up   there   with   apocalypse   now ,    platoon   is   a   terrifying   and   grittily   realistic   portrayal   of   the   vietnam   war .    charlie   sheen ['] s   finest   hour ?    this   and   hot   shots ,    yeah   i   think   so .
12848633	9940	3.0	it ['] s   a   classic ,    in   fact   the   classic   zombie   horror ,    so   cheesy   you   could   melt   the   dvd   onto   a   pizza   base   and   call   it   quatro   formatge .    but   you ['] ve   gotta   love   it .    everything :    the   embarassingly   bad   acting ,    the   pathetic   heroine ,    the   whole   premise    ( radiation   from   a   satelite   from   venus )  ,    the   fact   that   not   one   part   of   the   whole   movie   is   actually   scary .  .  .    and   yet    ( largely   due   to   the   fact   that   you   can ['] t   take   it   seriously )    it   gets   away   with   it !  !    classic !  !
12848633	5778	3.5	not   too   shabby ,    though   not   nearly   as   good   as   the   first   two .
12848633	13567	3.5	pretty   cool   though   for   some   reason   it   was   either   sleepy   or   hard   to   follow .    i   did   enjoy   it   but   for   some   reason   i   was   falling   asleep   at   the   end .
12848633	10673	3.5	i   grew   up   on   this   film .    literally .    every   day   i   stayed   home   sick   from   school   i ['] d   watch   this ,    as   well   as   top   gun .    and   yet   it   still   makes   me   laugh .    ok   i   take   back   all   i   said   about   american   comedy    -    there   are   some   corkers   out   there .
134386787	2913	4.0	this   was   really   good .    only   slightly   depressing   at   some   times .
134386787	10583	5.0	yup ,    it   rocked .
134386787	14691	5.0	the   best   thing   ever .
134386787	14584	5.0	a   classic .
134386787	13614	4.0	think   i   had   to   high   expectations   but   it ['] s   really   funny   a   few   times .    might   enjoy   it   more   if   you   work   in   a   cubicle   but   still   good .    the   printer   scene   is   a   classic .
134386787	13315	3.5	harry   potter   is   great .    the   books   are   about   a   lillion   times   better   than   the   movies   though .
134386787	468	4.0	liked   reloaded   more   actually .    have   to   see   this   again .  .  .  .
134386787	9913	4.0	second   renoissance    ( spelling ?  )  ,    final   flight   of   the   osiris   and   beyond   rocks .    and   the   skating   kid   is   pretty   cool .    and   the   detective   story   too .    the   others    -    not   so   great .
134386787	10421	3.0	most   people   like   this   one   more   than   one   and   two .    not   me .
118246102	7828	5.0	this   movie   is   like   amazing .  .  .    i ['] m   blown   away   from   the   complexity   of   the   plot   as   well   as   the   awesome   cinematography   and   music .    bravo .

['] the   wicker   man [']    defines   the   word   original -    it ['] s   not   really   a   musical   but   the   characters   sing   some   random   songs   throughout ,    and   it   leads   to   one   of   the   most   visceral ,    scariest   and   most   memorable   endings   i   have   ever   seen .       skip   the   shitty   remake .
174808986	7125	4.5	first   of   all ,    this   movie   doesn ['] t   fuck   around -    its   about   a   martial   arts   tournament ,    and   that ['] s   what   happens .       no   stupid   subplots ,    no   bullshit ,    just   the   fighting .       the   fighting   is   fantastic -    its   shot   in   a   very   documentary - like   fashion   and   gives   the   scenes   some   good   realism .       the   film   also   showcases   many   different   martial   arts   styles -    i   mean ,    you   even   get   to   see   monkey   fist .       how   cool   is   that ?

836507980	12471	2.5	it   was   surprisingly   good ,    but   i   wouldn ['] t   see   it   again
836507980	1962	5.0	another   one   of   my   favorites !       such   a   great   idea ,    and   just   the   right   blend   of   humor   and   romance !
370733854	14869	4.0	a   phillip   k   dick   based   film   that   works    ( one   of   few )  .    does   so   by   taking   the   concept   and   running   away   with   it .    everything   about   it   is   good .
370733854	2163	3.0	amusing   and   silly .
370733854	7664	2.5	does   what   is   does   well .    just   doesn ['] t   do   too   much ,    for   me   at   least .  .  .
370733854	15205	1.0	i   saw   this   on   a   bus   in   argentina .    not   the   best   film   watching   envonment .    still ,    i   didn ['] t   reckon   it   much   cop .
370733854	11173	3.5	good   if   not   a   little   surreal .
370733854	15853	1.0	rather   silly   and   crap .
370733854	17560	4.0	classic .    not   very   serious ,    but   witty   and   worth   watching   again   and   again .
633723021	7193	3.5	lovely   movie !    romance   meets   good   comedy .    yes ,    there   is   in   fact   some   romance   in   it .    there   had   to   be ,    or   otherwise   it   wouldn ['] t   work   at   all .    yes ,    there   is   a   princess   who   falls   madly   in   love   with   a    ['] farm   boy [']  ,    but   that ['] s   also   the   exact   thing   that   triggers   such   a   funny   plot   as   this   one .    plus ,    it   never   gets   lame   beyond   unacceptable ,    as   you ['] ve   got   this    ['] lameness   supervisor [']    kinda   character   who   always   makes   sure   things   don ['] t   get   too   much   on   the   mushy   side .  .  .       so ,    not   to   worry .    the   romance   factor   is   only   here   to   set   the   foundations   for   an   entertaining   humorous   screenplay .    in   fact ,    this   tale   is   told   in   such   a   way   that   i   believe   its   primary   purpose   is   to   make   you   laugh   other   than   move   you .       as   for   the   downside .  .  .    it   is   a   rather   old   movie ,    so .  .  .    do   not   expect   remarkable   special   effects ,    as   they ['] re   really   not   good   at   all .    but   i ['] m   sure   that   won ['] t   keep   you   from   enjoying   this   movie ,    nonetheless .
633723021	494	3.0	awww .  .  .    i   was   hoping   for   so   much   more .    and   it ['] s   not   that   it   wasn ['] t   funny ,    because   it   really   was .    but   most   of   the   times   it   was   only   giggly   funny ,    as   in    " didn ['] t   crack   me   up   like   it   was   supposed   to "  .    so ,    no   hard   laughs   while   i   was   watching   it .    well .  .  .    i   have   to   be   honest .  .  .    maybe   one   or   two   hard   laughs   along   the   way .    which   isn ['] t   really   quite   enough ,    in   my   opinion .    nonetheless ,    it   was   an   enjoyable   film .    and   the   best   feature   was ,    without   a   doubt ,    the   mockery   towards   society   and   religion .    even   the    " sacred   sperm "    song   managed   to   amuse   me .    and   that ['] s   really   a   lot   to   say ,    giving   the   fact   that   theme   songs   in   the   middle   of   a   movie   often   tend   to   annoy   me   and   sometimes   even   bore   me   to   death .    still .  .  .    it   didn ['] t   amuse   me   enough   in   the   overall .    not   enough   jokes .    not   enough   mockery .    not   enough   silliness .    and   they   had   it   all   to   accomplish   a   great   comedy   flick ,    as   society   and   religion   are   by   far   two   of   the   best   mockery   targets   one   can   possibly   think   of .    that   and   castelo   branco .

353371552	7193	5.0	i   love   this   film   there   is   something   magical   about   it .    perhaps   it   is   the   lack   of   special   effects .    this   films   always   reminds   me   of   the   flim   legend ,    which   i   also   like
353371552	5020	4.0	you   can   laugh   so   hard   that   your   sides   split
353371552	6911	1.5	i   saw   this   performed   on   stage   and   ten   times   better   then   the   film

353371552	16522	3.5	this   is      an   older   persons   film .    i   though   it   was   okay   but   my   gran   and   her   friends   think   that   it   is   the   best   thing   since   sliced   bread
353371552	8108	3.5	this   is   alot   funnier   then   i   thought   it   would   be
353371552	6531	1.0	this   was   so   boring ,    it   could   have   been   done   so   much   better   instead   they   brought   adam   sander   in   to   save   and   already   failed   film
353371552	2800	4.5	this   follows   the   classic   plot   that   is   done   so   brilliantly   that   you   almost   can   forsee   what   is   going   to   happen   next

353371552	3418	4.5	it   could   but   it   is   not   as   good   as   the   first   one
353371552	12090	4.5	this   is   briliiant   and   it   is   funny   in   places
353371552	5897	1.5	this   one   didn ['] t   have   me   on   the   edge   of   my   seat
353371552	17387	4.0	this   is   surprisingly   good   and   not   in   the   over   the   top   sex   way
353371552	16879	3.0	an   enjoyable   film   that   just   about   everyone   has   seen .    its      alittle   sad   at   the   end   though

356140956	2985	3.5	sweet   and   disturbing   at   the   same   time .  .  .    dat   opening   scene .  .  .    slightly   dodgy   i   lykd   it
356140956	2782	3.0	i   onli   watched   parts   of   this .  .  . but   i   found   it   average .  .
356140956	16879	3.5	lol   rose   hogged   the   stupid   door !  !  !       nah   but   it   was   sweet   in   many   ways

791720782	7032	4.0	mike   meyers   is   a   great   comedian   and   this   movie   showcased   his   talent   extraordinary
791720782	3860	2.5	average   movie   for   jim   carey .  .    could   have   been   better
791720782	15063	5.0	this   movie   scored   huge   in   my   book   just   for   having   run   dmc    " its   tricky "    in   it .  .  .    quite   humorous   too

487567871	4330	4.0	i   remember   seeing   this   movie ,    you   have   to   watch   it   all   the   way   through ;    if   you   start   an   hour   in ,    you   get   confused .
487567871	2342	3.5	this   was   funny ;    and   disgusting .
487567871	1145	4.0	fun - ny !
487567871	7509	2.0	the   sfx   are   crap
487567871	17426	4.5	i   love   this   film !
487567871	3079	3.5	i   saw   this   on   stage   in   london   with   my   school .    ab   fab
781939705	12262	4.0	a   classic !    i   watch   this   every   christmas .    that   tree   is   awesome .
781939705	6531	4.5	underrated .    one   of   sandler ['] s   best   performances .
781939705	17508	2.5	overrated .  .  .
781939705	3875	4.0	great   road   movie .
781939705	9340	3.0	the   part   that   actually   shows   the   attack   on   pearl   harbor   is   well   done ,    everything   else   is   crap .
781939705	7875	2.5	i   love   this   skit ,    but   the   movie   was   missing   a   lot ,    namely ,    a   plot .
781939705	4829	4.0	this   movie   is   amazing ,    and   i   don ['] t   even   watch   zombie   movies .
781939705	9637	3.0	you   had   me   at   cliche .  .  .
781939705	6556	4.0	i   like   it .    john   leguizamo ['] s   a   badass .
781939705	6085	4.0	early   sound   mystery   film   by   fritz   lang .    stars   peter   lorre   and   contains   a   very   catchy   whistle   tune .
781939705	5582	5.0	my   all - time   favorite .    great   dark   story   and   one   of   the   greatest   plot   twists   in   movie   history .
781939705	9886	2.0	worst   of   the   prequels .    bad   acting   from   good   actors   all   around .    pod   race   and   lightsaber   battle   are   pretty   cool   though .
781939705	13707	3.0	overrated .    pacino ['] s   acting   is   good ,    but   the   movie   feels   really   dated .    seems   like   there ['] s   just   a   lot   of   violence   with   out   much   of   a   point .
781939705	2690	3.5	oddly   offbeat   for   disney ,    but   that ['] s   a   good   thing .
414309721	13610	3.0	why   did   they   have   to   cast   cider   house   wussie   as   spidey ?
414309721	7664	5.0	infinitely   quotable
414309721	11337	3.0	classic .    low - brow   or   not
414309721	12471	3.0	not   that   bad .    maybe   i   just   dont   keep   it   gangster   enough
414309721	3579	3.0	terrible   if   they   hadn ['] t   of   jumped   the   car   onto   the   boat

53849038	3195	4.0	made   me   cry .    i   think ?    i   watched   it   in   history   class .
53849038	15205	2.0	meh .    i   lost   interest   after   a   while .

121860114	2457	4.0	great ,    it ['] s   modernized ,    but   still   cool
121860114	16879	3.0	touching ,    probably   the   best   i   have   seen   in   the   20th   century .
121860114	6196	4.5	corny .  .  .    i   just   like   the   80s
121860114	7032	2.0	funny .  .
121860114	14312	2.5	it ['] s   like   1   hr   of   intro ,    and   the   rest   action .
121860114	3860	4.0	bruce   almighty   playing   god ,    that ['] s   funny

846992346	2985	4.0	stupid   funny   is   my   thing

269106688	15107	4.0	good   movie
269106688	7521	2.5	silly   but   funny .
269106688	1962	5.0	i   really   liked   this   one   actually .       i   normally   wouldnt   think   that   adam   sandler   or   drew   barrymore   were   that   great   of   actors ,    but   they   pulled   it   off   in   this   one .
535630336	3463	1.0	nothing   about   it   stands   out .  .  .
535630336	2463	0.5	i   was   dragged   to   see   this    -    superheroes   are   not   my   thing
535630336	3864	1.5	i   was   dragged   to   this    -    don ['] t   like   superheroes
535630336	1905	3.0	johnny   depp   channels   a   rock   star    ( he   says   keith   richards ,    but   i   think   he   totally   rips   off   al   jourgensen )  ;    it ['] s   hard   to   go   wrong   with   pirates
535630336	5991	1.0	also   gross    &    pointless ,    but   interesting   visual   techniques
215265412	2985	4.0	i   loved   everys   second   of   watching   it .
215265412	5571	2.0	im   not   a   fan   of   the   rocky   movies .    whats   the   point   in   watching   2   guys   beat   the   shit   out   of   each   other .
215265412	15205	3.5	not   enough   action .
215265412	5239	3.0	good   music .
215265412	3938	3.0	not   as   funny   as   i   thought   it   would   be   but   it   was   still   funny .    the   whole    " it ['] s   a   thong !  !  "    was   so   funny
329735083	13610	3.0	good ,    not   my   fave   type   of   film   tho   and   kirsten   dunast   is   a   bit   annoying   with   red   hair
329735083	14691	5.0	brilliant   story   and   theology   involved ,    other   two   movies   were   pants   tho
329735083	7664	5.0	loved   it   and   cried   but   love   a   movie   that   i   can   sob   to
329735083	758	1.5	boring   if   you   are   over   14
329735083	3320	4.0	funny   and   original
329735083	6235	5.0	great   love   story   emphasising   importance   of   faith   and   love   in   times   of   trouble ,    brilliant
298336212	3962	4.0	i   loved   dory .  .  .  . great   childs   movie
298336212	7664	2.0	this   was   tragical .  .  . to   much   blood
298336212	3860	4.0	this   is   a   good   movie .  .  . but   jim   carey   dosent   have   that   romantic   side
298336212	10928	1.0	doopy   movie
232357396	10583	4.5	jack   black   is   a   champion .
232357396	7664	5.0	amazing ,    what   we   do   in   life   echoes   for   eternity .
232357396	17324	2.0	for   real   i   rented   this
232357396	2463	4.5	" super "    good ,    ah   thank   you
232357396	6287	3.0	kinda   could   go   either   way ,    i   dont   know   why   but   ppl   love   it .    the   movie   is   about   a   smut   who   bangs   a   guy   and   then   he   loves   her
232357396	16969	3.5	its   good   but   not   as   good   as   the   hype ,    jake   gyllenhall   is   a   tool
232357396	5991	5.0	should   have   won   an   oscar ,    but   apparently   gay   cowboys   is   more   interesting
371810813	12074	5.0	brilliant   musical ,    who   can   resist    " lonely   goatherd "  ?       singing ,    mountains   and   nazis ,    who   can   ask   for   more ?
371810813	5496	4.0	surprisingly   good .
371810813	16415	4.0	it ['] s   a   cheesy   film ,    robin   camps   it   up   quite   a   lot ,    but   it ['] s   nathan   lane   that   really   steals   the   show .       even   thinking   about   it   now ,    the   john   wayne   bit   still   cracks   me   up .
371810813	4472	0.5	fine   up   until   the   point   that   the   prime   minister   grows   a   pair   and   tells   the   president   where   to   go    -    wholly   unrealistic .       especially   as   it   was   over   a   lady ['] s   honour .
371810813	11999	0.5	don ['] t   watch   it ,    really ,    it   will   make   you   want   to   go   out   and   kill   rob   schneider ,    then   yourself .
371810813	9298	2.0	went   to   see   it   at   the   cinema ,    not   knowing   anything   about   it   apart   from   the   fact   it   was   a   tarantino   movie .       the   first   half   an   hour   was   great .       then   they   all   turned   into   vampires ,    which   was   quite   a   shock   to   us .       then   spent   the   rest   of   the   film   laughing   our   asses   off ,    and   not   in   a   good   way .
448565659	985	4.5	wonderful   story ,    especially   for   those   who   love   egyptology .       one   of   my   favorites .
448565659	197	4.0	sexy
448565659	17088	2.0	funny ,    but   not .
448565659	13302	4.0	funny   as   always   with   mel   brooks .
448565659	4956	4.5	very   interesting   to   see   marty   have   to   duck   himself   in   the   past .    hillarious .
448565659	17714	4.0	a   wonderful   love   story   that   marks   the   beginning   of   the   golden   age   of   disney

448565659	16438	4.0	great   80s   soundtrack   and   wonderful   ending .
448565659	6482	3.0	funny   bar   scene   if   you   watch   it   in   spanish   with   english   subtitles
448565659	10921	2.0	dumb   ashton   kutcher   humor .    most   people   plan   their   honeymoon   better .
448565659	8752	4.5	funny !    awesome !    what   more   can   i   say ?
448565659	10820	3.5	great   movie   that   makes   you   wonder   if   you   would   hang   out   with   your   parents   if   you   were   there   when   they   were   kids .
448565659	753	4.5	one   of   the   best   disney   movies   ever !  !
448565659	5472	3.5	hillarious

397344400	4906	4.0	ok
808063221	15110	3.0	of   the   resident   evil   series ,    i   didn ['] t   like   this   one .    the   scenes   weren ['] t   linked   togther   very   well ,    but   it   did   pay   good   homage   to   the   game .
808063221	15409	4.5	probably   my   favourite   out   of   all   the    "  .  .  .    trip "    movies .    i   had   a   lot   of   laughs   and   it   has   a   great   soundtrack .  .  .    it   also   has   jessica   böers    ( novaspace )    as   the   german   hot   chick !     :  )
808063221	3533	4.5	this   movie   gets   such   a   high   rating   just   for   the   fact   that   the   whole   is   done   with   puppets !    also   how   they   created   such   huge   detailed   puppet   props   and   then   blew   it   up   xd   it ['] s   cheezy   but   overall   a   funny   film .     :  )
808063221	14103	4.5	wasn ['] t   a   bad   movie .  .    good   storyline ,    some   parts   were   a   bit   obvious   though .  .    and   the   music   was   interesting .    overall   though ,    it   was   a   pretty   good   movie ,    watchable .
808063221	15853	4.5	loved   it   after   playing   so   many   of   the   games .
808063221	2457	3.5	i   love   adaptations   of   stories ,    and   this   modern   day   version   of   cinderella   is   quite   well   done .    hilary   duff   looks   and   does   spectactular   as   cinderella   and   chad   michael   murray   does   a   likewise   great   job   as   the   prince .    good   soundtrack   too .
808063221	631	3.5	the   storyline   was   a   bit   average   i   thought .    the   martial   arts   weren ['] t   too   bad   and   i   do   enjoy   jet   li   as   a   actor / martial   arts   figher .    not   his   best   movie   but   isn ['] t   terrible   either .
808063221	7745	4.0	i ['] ve   always   been   a   fan   of   space   movies ,    and   this   is   actually   based   on   the   true   story   of   apollo   13 .    the   3rd   space   mission   to   the   moon .    actually   quite   a   good   and   powerful   movie .
808063221	758	4.0	despite   the   chick - flickyness   of   this   movie ,    certain   parts   i   really   laughed   at .
808063221	331	1.5	i   did   not   like   this   movie .    waaaaayyyy   too   overdramatic .    at   one   point   i   actually   looked   at   the   time   to   see   when   it   would   end .  .  .    certain   parts   were   entertaining ,    but   on   the   whole ,    not   a   fan .
808063221	14712	3.0	saw   this   a   few   years   ago .  .  .    not   sure   if   angelina   jolie   is   the   right   person   for    " lara   croft "    but   it   was   okay ,    i   guess .
808063221	5401	2.5	it   was   funny   here   and   there   but   it   was   a   bit   of   a   odd   concept   for   a   movie   xd
808063221	3195	4.5	a   very   good   war   movie .    if   you   like   war   movies   this   is   one   you   have   to   see .    it   is   a   tad   gruesome   though   at   some   points .
808063221	11745	0.5	i   thought   that   this   was   a   very   poor   movie ,    in   comparison   to   some   of   the   other   marvell   movies   and   characters .
808063221	3917	3.5	a   lot   of   people   seemed   to   think   it   was   a   really   good   movie   for   some   reason .  .    zach   braff   helps   a   bit   but   the   movie   value   itself   didn ['] t   blow   me   away   or   anything .
808063221	13115	3.5	it   is   a   bit   cheezy   and   predictable   at   some   points ,    but   hilary   duff   does   a   good   job   especially   with   her   singing    :  )
808063221	3320	4.5	another   one   of   my   favourite   movies ,    and   mostly   accredited   to   hugh   grant ,    i   love   his   sarcastic   role   throughout   the   film .    always   entertaining .
808063221	7624	4.5	one   of   my   all   time   favourites .    classic ,    and   a   good   soundtrack   too !
808063221	4171	1.0	a   bit   too   silly   for   me .
808063221	1744	4.5	if   there   was   anything   that   eddie   movie   really   did   star   well   in ,    it   is   the   beverly   hills   cop   movies .    they ['] re   old   but   they ['] ve   got   great   humour ,    always   entertaining .
808063221	5692	3.0	it   has   its   funny   moments .  .
808063221	6350	4.5	i   really   love   jackie   chan .    paired   with   chris   rock   and   chucked   into   an   action   film ,    it ['] s   got   to   be   one   of   the   best   action - comedy   series   ever .
808063221	14538	4.0	was   a   fun   movie   and   certain   parts   made   me   laugh .
808063221	295	4.0	funny .
808063221	3864	4.5	i   thought   this   was   actually   a   really   good   movie .    i   was   surprised   but   it   really   did   stike   a   chord   with   me .    good   action   flick   and   very   cool   gadgets    :  )
808063221	6972	5.0	this   has   actually   got   to   be   one   of   my   favourite   movies   of   all   time .    bruce   willis   does   an   incredble   job   in   acting ,    there   is   a   great   cast ,    a   powerful   storyline   backed   up   with   a   great   soundtrack   and   score .    really   a   popcorn   movie   and   very   emotional ,    it   will   probably   make   you   cry    = p   definately   watch   it   if   you   haven ['] t   yet !     ;  )
808063221	3860	4.5	i   love   jim   carey   in   this   one .    morgan   freeman   is   also   another   good   actor   in   this   one .
808063221	607	4.0	it ['] s   a   good   movie   and   does   keep   you   entertained .    it ['] s   quite   a   thriller .
676375419	3463	3.0	it   was   okay   that   movie .    could   have   been   better .
676375419	15205	4.0	love   how   the   movie   tells   how   we   are   going   to   live   the   next   day   and   so   on .
676375419	16879	2.5	well   not   my   type   but   leanardo   great   actor .
676375419	11337	4.0	it   was   a   great   movie   and   funny   i   love   the   humour   and   how   it   got   presented .
676375419	7521	3.0	okay   funny   hilarious   and   lots   of   comedy
522460410	9565	4.0	this   was   a   pretty   good   movie .       i   love   the   survivor   song ,    eye   of   the   tiger   and   that   helped   out   a   lot .       i   heard   it   a   lot   in   high   school   due   to   the   fact   the   mascot   was   a   tiger .       lol .       it   was   sad   that   mickey   died   but   it   brought   out   a   new   world   that   rocky   and   to   face   and   eventually   beat .
522460410	2372	5.0	i   personally   think   that   this   was   a   great   movie .       i   was   unhappy   with   the   beginning   of   the   movie ,    but   it   did   pick   up   at   the   end   and   bring   a   lot   of   stuff   to   light   about   jason   bourne .       i   am   never   a   fan   of   sequals   but   this   movie   maintained   the   level   of   action   and   kept   the   plot   going   like   the   bourne   identity .       i   have   high   hopes   for   the   upcoming   bourne   ultimatum .
522460410	10358	4.5	this   one   isn ['] t   as   good   as   ocean ['] s   eleven ,    but   it   is   worth   watching
522460410	16387	2.0	not   as   good   as   the   original .
522460410	2412	4.0	i   didn ['] t   like   this   movie   to   much   since   it   didn ['] t   have   the   cool   stuff   about   the   firebolt   getting   taken   from   harry   and   him   eventually   getting   it   back .  .  .    they   should   have   stayed   closer   to   what   the   book   said .
522460410	12399	4.0	i   am   on   a   paranormal   movie   kick ,    and   anything   with   witches ,    vampires ,    or   werewolves   are   great   in   my   book .       i   love   how   they   make   this   a   paranormal   romantic   movie .       it   just   makes   you   happy   at   the   end .       so   just   watch   it   if   you   need   a   romantic   life .
522460410	2009	4.5	this   is   one   of   the   creepiest   roles   that   i   think   that   matt   damon   plays   but   it   is   a   great   movie
522460410	10170	3.0	this   one   wasn ['] t   as   good   as   the   first   but   its   worth   watching .
522460410	12335	4.0	i   know   this   was   made   for   tv ,    but   i   really   enjoyed   this   movie .     ( surprising   since   it   was   made   for   tv   and   most   are   crap .  )
522460410	9205	3.0	the   dog   always   reminds   me   of   a   hunting   dog   that   my   dad   had   so   i   guess   i   like   the   movie   because   of   the   dog .     ( the   dog   we   had   slobbered   a   lot .  )
522460410	940	5.0	i   just   like   this   movie .  .  .    don ['] t   know   why .  .  .    i   like   the   music   and   just   the   movie   overall .
522460410	1561	4.0	really   funny ,    especially   when   you   go   see   it   with   friends
522460410	2593	5.0	this   has   to   be   one   of   my   favorite   disney   movies   of   all   time .
522460410	5582	4.0	besides   episode   1 ,    i   think   this   is   my   least   favorite   of   the   series .       i   know   it   has   the   great   luke   i   am   your   father   statement .  .  .  .    but   i   thought   the   opening   stuff   on   the   hoth   planet   wasn ['] t   that   great   nor   the   battle   scene .       the   stuff   with   han   solo   was   great   and   made   me   interested   to   see   jedi .
522460410	10344	3.0	haven ['] t   seen   this   one   in   a   long   time ,    but   from   what   i   remember   it   was   an   alright   movie .
522460410	17764	5.0	this   movie   was   great .       i   so   have   to   get   this   movie   on   dvd .       people   have   to   see   this   movie .
522460410	28	5.0	stitch   is   awesome .  .  .    my   friend   can   sound   exactly   like   him   and   it   just   makes   me   laugh .       i   think   that   this   was   a   very   cute   movie   that   establishes   good   values   too .
522460410	14248	4.5	love   the   ending   with   queen   playing   out   the   end .
522460410	3079	5.0	i   can ['] t   tell   you   how   many   times   i   have   watched   this   movie   and   i   still   love   it .
782166339	13610	1.5	i   pretty   much   have   come   to   hate   this   series .  .  .

782166339	15107	3.5	not   the   best ,    but   a   fun   film .
782166339	3860	3.0	not   bad ,    not   great ,    but   enjoyable .

439399418	16740	3.0	first   of   all   i   really   want   to   know   why   the   name   of   the   movie   is   magnolia ?    anyway ,    the   movie   is   a   little   bit   overrated   on   my   opinion .    the   begining   looked   very   promising ,    but   between   the   begining   and   the   end   there   is   just   a   too   slow   and   not   finished   idea   filled   with   very   good   actors .    it ['] s   too   depressing   on   the   one   side   and   too   superficial   on   the   other   side .    off   course   i   can ['] t   say   there   are   not   some   great   scenes   in   it .    i   loved   some   parts ,    but      i   expected   more   after   reading   such   a   good   critics .  .  .
439399418	143	4.5	this   move   you   can   watch   only   once ,    but   that   one   time   pay   a   good   attention !
439399418	1109	5.0	i   adore   this   movie !    it ['] s   a   musical   comedie   that   became   cult   movie .    audrey   hepburn   is   fantastic   actresses   and   her   ability   to   change   her   accent   in   this   movie   is   above   perfect .
439399418	14042	5.0	ok , if   you   want   to   watch   this   movie   you   have   to   prepare   for   one   very   confusing   but   still   a   brilliant   dream !    this   is   one   of   the   best   movies   lynch   has   ever   made .  .  .
439399418	6886	5.0	loved   all   those   movie   scenes   from   old   movies .    very   inspiring   dialogs ,    but   there   are   a   lot   of   sick   brother - sister   relationship   scenes .    still   i   think   it ['] s   a   wonderfull   film .
439399418	2122	4.0	incredibly   original   movie !    one   of   the   best   fantasy   movies   i   have   ever   seen !    you   may   search   for   all   sorts   of   reasons   and   points   in   it   but   on   the   other   hand   you   may   just   enjoy   it !    it ['] s   a   great   imaginative   movie !

336730401	5991	4.5	the   only   film   based   on   a   comic ,    where   they   really   manage   to   get   that   comic   feeling .    the   story   etc   is   great   aswell .    if   u   havent   seen   this   see   it .
456850028	10774	4.5	i   think   any   movie   that   features   guns   popping   out   of   sleeves   has   the   potential   for   being   cooler   than   most   movies ,    and   taxi   driver   had      it   before   desperado   made   it   look   cool .    not   my   favorite   film ,    but   de   niro ['] s   performance   as   the   tortured   sociopath   with   a   hero - complex   is   something   anybody   who ['] s   ever   felt   lonely   and   outcast   can   relate   to   to   some   degree .
456850028	6450	5.0	i   was   enthralled .    it   is   simply   amazing .    city   of   god   takes   place   in   a   small   subsection   of   rio   de   janeiro ,    a   microcosm   of   anarchy   and   rampant   criminal   activity   where   the   same   rules   which   govern   the   rest   of   the   world   apply .    just   like   anywhere   else   in   the   world ,    violence   is   a   cycle ,    and   love   is   its   natural   suppressor .    when   one   is   frustrated   in   the   pursuit   of   love ,    it   also   acts   as   a   potential   catalyst   for   violence .    apathy   is   a   characteristic   of   a   monster .    there   are   power   struggles   among   the   children   here ,    who   frolic   the   streets   with   handguns .    they   grow   up   with   an   infinite   desire   for   validation   from   others   and   so   in   turn   lead   a   murderous ,    cutthroat   lifestyle .    but   why   does   it   have   to   be   so   full   of   drugs   and   guns ?    because   it   is   a   world   of   poverty ,    and   these   things   speak   louder   in   these   enclosed   societies   than   factory   labor   and   selling   fish .    it   reminded   me   of   the   child   soldiers   from   blood   diamond ,    except   in   this   movie   everything   just   felt   more   real   and   less   contrived . the   movie   does   start   off   a   bit   confusing ,    and   the   direction   was   jarring   at   first ,    but   once   i   began   to   know   who ['] s   who ,    i   forgot   i   was   watching   a   movie   because   i   was   so   absorbed   by   it .    i   couldn ['] t   hold   back   my   tears   during   a   particular   scene .    it ['] s   surprising   because   i   felt   that   the   movie   was   rather   unimpressive   at   first ,    but   it   just   becomes   this   powerful   film   once   the   gears   started   rolling .    i   have   some   slight   gripes   with   some   of   the   direction .    i   think   some   characters   just   seem   way   too   happy   waving   their   guns   everywhere    ( especially   the   children )    when   they   should   look   more   threatening ,    but   that ['] s   just   me .    the   movie   is   episodic   in   nature ,    spanning   two   decades   in   this   cesspool   of   criminal   activity ,    and   the   anti - violence   message   is   not   in   your   face ,    but   it ['] s   there .    i ['] d   recommend   it   for   anyone   looking   for   a   movie   about   a   crazy   place .
456850028	13439	4.5	i   thought   it   ended   rather   abruptly   when   i   first   watched   it ,    with   a   lot   of   great   scenes   with   vince   vaughn .    it   wasn ['] t   until   i   re - visited   some   parts   and   allowed   them   to   simmer   a   bit   that   i   began   to   realize   that   this   movie   is   so   fucking   money .     " you   don ['] t   look   at   the   things   you   have .    you   only   look   at   the   stuff   you   don ['] t   have .    those   guys   are   right   about   you ,    you ['] re   money .

456850028	2422	2.5	i   felt   stupid   while   watching   this   film .    it   was   as   though   i   was   the   only   one   who   missed   out   on   touching   that   black   monolith   in   the   movie   2001   and   didn ['] t   evolve   in   time   to   comprehend   what   the   fuck   these   two   uber - intelligent   white   guys   were   talking   about .    primer   is   consisted   of   two   talking   heads   babbling   scientific   jargon   which   will   make   very   little   sense   unless   you ['] ve   seen   it   more   than   once    ( or   maybe   you ['] ll   get   it   all   the   first   time ,    you   evolved   starchild )  .    for   a   moment ,    i   felt   like   i   needed   to   write   things   down   just   to   follow   the   plot .    it   deals   with   time   travel ,    so   it   has   to   be   confusing   in   some   way ,    but   unlike   donnie   darko ,    which   dealt   with   a   similar   concept ,    primer   doesn ['] t   have   that   same   charm   the   aforementioned   film   had ,    so   i   never   felt   strongly   compelled   to   embrace   the   idea   of   revisiting   it   numerous   times   to   piece   together   its   puzzle .    it   lacks   emotion ,    and   is   seemingly   machinelike   in   its   way   of   thinking .    this   equaled   a   movie   i   cared   very   little   about   in   the   long   run .    on   the   other   hand ,    primer   has   a   very   intriguing   and   imaginative   concept ,    and   it   builds   a   dialogue - driven   story   around   it   using   a   small   budget .    i   could   appreciate   the   film   from   that   angle ,    but   that   still   doesn ['] t   change   the   fact   that   it   makes   me   feel   like   an   un - evolved   primate .

783791465	16879	1.5	it   was   to   slow   for   my   tastes    ,    had   the   story   been   better   i   might   have   liked   it   more
783791465	15205	1.0	this   movie   was   soo   unrealistic   that   it   was   stupid
783791465	7032	4.0	these   movies   are   sexy   and   hillarious   at   the   same   time    ,    a   great   mix
783791465	1962	2.5	meh   this   was   a   ok   movie    ,    not   too   terribly   funny    ,    but   it   was   ok   i   guess
153556535	3385	4.0	probably   the   most   realistic   zombie   movie   if   zombies   attacked   but   kind   of   slow
153556535	6037	4.0	i   know   it ['] s   pretty   pathetic   it   took   me   this   long   to   watch   this ,    but   i   finally   got   around   to   it .       i   want   to   add   one   more   thing   before   i   go   into   my   review ,    i   grew   up   with   james   bond   films   and   still   love   them ,    and   i   still   prefer   james   bond   to   jason   bourne .       with   that   said ,    this   was   a   very   well   done   spy   action   movie .       great   plot ,    great   acting ,    and   absolutely   amazing   hand   to   hand   fights .       overall ,    if   you   love   action / spy   movies ,    you   must   watch   this   in   between   james   bond   films .
153556535	6329	4.5	tim   burton   is   a   genius   with   this   movie .
153556535	17169	4.0	started   out   really   good   but   the   ending   didn ['] t   live   up   to   the   rest   of   the   movie
153556535	3864	5.0	definitely   the   best   batman
153556535	16954	4.0	having   sean   connery   play   indy ['] s   dad   was   a   great   idea   but   i   preferred   the   first   to   indy   movies
153556535	12221	4.5	a   great   movie   that   i   would ['] ve   missed   had   it   not   been   for   school .       we   read   the   book   and   watched   the   movie   in   8th   grade ,    and   i   really   enjoyed   both .       the   outsiders   is   one   of   the   few   movies   that   stays   practically   100 %    accurate   to   the   book ,    and   i   really   respect   and   appreciate   it .       one   of   the   fun   parts   of   this      movie   is   to   see   all   the   actors   when   they   were   very   young .       for   some ,    this   was   their   first   movie .       the   sets   really   set   the   mood   for   the   entire   movie   as   the   church   seems   peaceful ,    the   burger   joint   feels   like   classic   50 ['] s ,    and   the   fights   seem   real .       i   definitely   recommend   checking   out   both   the   book   and   the   movie .

253224316	17479	3.5	a   little   creepy ,    but   not   as   scary   as   i   thought   it   would   be !

253224316	985	4.5	this   is   great .    i   think   the   cast   pull   it   off   well   in   this   film ,    which   helps   make   it   so   much   better !
253224316	2400	3.0	enjoyable ,    but   not   sure   i   would   want   to   watch   it   too   many   times !    i   find   culkin   slightly   irritating !  !
253224316	2782	4.5	['] they ['] ll   never   take   our   freedom [']
253224316	16969	0.5	i   did   not   like   this   film !  !  !    maybe   i   just   didn ['] t   get   it !  !    although ,    i   consider   the   fact   i   got   through   it   an   achievement !  !
253224316	11929	3.0	an   enjoyable   movie   with   a   decent   story   and   acting ,    not   sure   i   would   want   to   watch   it   a   lot   though .
253224316	16438	3.5	some   good   moments   of   comedy .    yet ,    not   one   of   sandler ['] s   films   i   would   choose   to   watch   too   often .
253224316	9757	3.0	a   good   family   film ,    with   some   great   elemenst   for   children .    not   sure   i   would   watch   it   now   though !
253224316	4656	5.0	i   think   julia   is   great   in   this   movie ,    not   just   because   of   the   clothes   she   wears .    more   emotional   as   it ['] s   based   on   a   true   story .
253224316	3864	4.5	not   a   major   batman   fan ,    btu   this   film   was   really   good .    not   quite   so    ['] cheesey [']  ,    although   some   people   might   like   that !
253224316	6287	5.0	well ,    it ['] s   pretty   woman .  .  .    i   can   deal   with   admittance   to   liking   it !  !  !

253224316	14621	5.0	yep ,    i   am   donkey !    i   just   go   on ,    and   on ,    and   on .  .  .  .
253224316	12497	5.0	this   is   a   fantastic   feel   good   movie .    it ['] s   just   pure   fun !    love   it !    sequel .  .  .    not   so   hot !
116666855	5705	5.0	okay   the   dialogue   may   be   a   bit   cheesy   in   parts   but   in   the   end   its   star   wars   and   its   good .    i   like   christopher   lee   in   this   film ,    although   he   seemed   a   little   wasted .
116666855	15844	4.0	this   was   a   great   film ,    based   on   a   true   story   which   made   it   seem   all   the   more   better .    denzal   washington   is   great   in   the   film .    surprisingly   better   than   i   expected .
116666855	13074	2.0	i   started   watching   this   film   and   it   was   total   poo .    can ['] t   be   bothered   explaining   why .  .  .  . my   hands   are   too   cold   to   type .  .  .  . arghhh
116666855	1905	4.5	this   a   really   cool   film   with   a   great   cast .    johnny   depp   is   really   funny   and   plays   his   part   well .       it   had   the   potential   to   be   a   total   mess   this   film   i   think ,    but   it   is   done   brilliantly .       a   fun   enjoyable   adventure   film .
116666855	7219	4.0	i   am   giving   this   film   4   stars   because   i   like   the   actors   in   it   and   their   performances   were   actually   very   good .    it   was   a   fairly   good   film .    i   disliked   the   music .    it   seemed   silly   and   out   of   place   and   there   were   a   few   scenes   in   the   film   which   were   quite   cheesy .    i   don ['] t   know   whether   it   was   intentional   or   not   but   it   didn ['] t   seem   to   work .  .  .  . the   train   station   scene   for   example .    after   watching   this   film   a   second   time   i   like   a   little   more .    it   has   a   likeable   quality   about   it   and   some   classic   lines .
116666855	14755	0.5	this   was   crappy   and   weird   and   made   no   sense   at   the   end
116666855	2743	5.0	a   great   film ,    which   is   very   moving .    adrien   brody   is   great   in   this   film .
116666855	3938	4.0	great   cast ,    briliant   animation   and   really   funny .
116666855	12785	5.0	good   and   just   as   good   as   x - men   2   and   x - men   3 .    stays   true   to   the   comic   book   feel .    i   think   most   of   the   characters   have   an   equal   amount   of   screen   time ,    which   doesn ['] t   seem   to   happen   in   x - men   2   or   x - men   3   which   seems   to   focus   more   on   wolverine ,    which   is   a   shame .    however   the   film   is   very   good   and   has   some   great   acting   from   patrick   stewart   and   ian   mckellen .
116666855	4384	3.5	an   ok   film .    it   had   its   moments ,    but   there   was   little   characterisation   which   i   felt   let   it   down   somewhat .    also   i   don ['] t   like   how   the   zombies   have   to   move   really   fast .    however   i   liked   the   opening   titles   and   there   were   some   good   points .    overall   i   feel   it   could   have   been   a   lot   better   than   it   was .
116666855	9426	4.5	a   really   good   war   film ,    which   also   shows   the   human   side   of   conflict .    possibly   one   of   the   best   war   films   ever   made .
116666855	17621	3.5	i   love   the   opening   sequence .
116666855	14571	5.0	just   as   good   as   the   first !
116666855	4393	4.0	i   don ['] t   really   like   jim   carey .    but   i ['] ed   have   to   say   this   is   one   of   his   better   films   and   suits   his   style   of   acting .
116666855	4697	4.5	brillitant   performances   from   al   pacino   and   robert   de   niro ,    great   cinematography   and   an   incredible   shoot   out   scene   make   this   film   a   classic .
116666855	11607	5.0	why   don   cheadle   never   won   an   oscar   for   this   film   and   only   got   nominated   i ['] ll   never   know .    shows   the   horror   of   the   genocide   in   rwanda .    a   film   everyone   should   see .
116666855	4698	4.0	i   thought   this   wasn ['] t   a   bad   sequel .    still   had   some   of   the   elements   which   made   the   first   film   good ,    but   it   still   couldn ['] t   live   up   to   its   predecessor .
116666855	14218	4.0	i   thought   this   film   was   great .    kathy   bates   and   james   caan   were   brilliant   in   it .    a   great   thriller   and   one   of   the   best   i   have   ever   seen .    good   stuff !
116666855	14203	1.0	this   was   good   at   the   time   but   is   rubbish   now .    thank   god   for   batman   begins .    although   only   slightly   better   than   batman   and   robin   this   film   is   still   rubbish .    the   only   tiny   little   piece   of   good   are   jim   carrey   and   tommy   lee   jones   who   try   their   best   to   pull   off   credible   performances   as   the   riddler   and   two - face   respectivly .    if   you   have   to   see   a   batman   film ,    i   would   recommend   tim   burton ['] s   batman   or   the   even   better   batman   begins .
116666855	7499	4.0	a   cool   film .    a   big   epic ,    where   aliens   come   to   blow   the   hell   out   of   everything   on   earth .    i   think   will   smith   is   good   in   this   film   as   well   as   jeff   goldblum .
116666855	5862	4.5	christopher   nolan   is   a   genius .    this   is   an   original   and   engrossing   movie .    its   certainly   one   you   want   to   watch   again   straight   away .    good   acting   by   the   cast ,    i   especially   liked   joe   pantoliano .    overall   a   amazing   film .
116666855	8840	4.0	a   great   cast ,    with   great   performances   throughout .    a   gripping ,    thoughtful   and   moving   story .    joel   schumacher   has   possibly   redeemed   himself   in   my   eyes   after   the   disgrace   of   batman   and   robin .    it   appears   he   can   make   a   good   film !
116666855	6134	5.0	well   acted ,    stylish   and   very   realistic .    a   great   film ,    set   as   i   recall   entirely   at   night ,    against   the   backdrop   of   los   angeles .    this   film   reminded   me   that   tom   cruise   can   actually   act .    slightly   slow   at   the   beginning ,    but   slow   doesn ['] t   always   equal   boring .    suspense   is   built   up   throughout   and   the   film   has   some   good   action   scenes .
116666855	10607	4.0	good   film .    not   over   the   top   like   some   american   war   movies   can   be .    well   made ,    well   acted .
116666855	14550	4.5	an   uplifting   story   of   friendship ,    hope   and   survival .    excellently   directed   by   frank   darabont   in   his   debut   directing   role .    really   good   performances   throughout   by   tim   robbins   and   morgan   freeman .    freeman   also   narates   the   story   the   way   only   he   can .
116666855	16969	4.0	a   really   good ,    but   also   really   strange   film .    i   really   want   to   see   it   again .
116666855	11165	1.0	did   not   get   this   film   at   all ,    although   i   did   it   watch   it   from   half   way   through .    the   scene   with   the   apes   and   that   famous   music   was   good   though !
116666855	3864	5.0	this   is   a   far   superior   film   than   previous   batman   installments .    director   christopher   nolan   restores   the   franchise   and   explores   the   origins   of   batman   and   why   he   became   who   he   did .    a   much   darker   and   more   serious   film ,    with   one   of   my   favourite   casts   for   a   movie .    everyone   is   cast   perfectly ,    christian   bale    ( who   puts   on   a   flawless   american   accent )       is   an   excellent   batman .    while   michael   caine ,    gary   oldman ,    liam   neeson ,    morgan   freeman   and   cillian   murphy   lend   great   support .    the   only   weak   actor   is   katie   holmes .    however   her   acting   does   not   detract   from   the   overall   quality   of   the   film .    the   cast ,    the   acting ,    the   dialogue ,    the   music   and   directing   are   all   fantastic .    one   of   my   all   time   favourites !
116666855	9265	3.5	this   is   a   very   dark   batman   and   its   kind   of   crazy   and   wacky .    however   it   does   have   its   good   parts .
116666855	3446	4.5	this   is   an   excellent   film .    a   beautiful   animation ,    with   such   detail   and   colours .    a   wonderful ,    creative   yet   also   strange   storyline .    this   puts   any   animation   disney   could   do   to   shame .
116666855	11152	5.0	this   was   a   really   powerful   film .    all   i   can   say   is ,    go   see   it .    edward   norton ['] s   acting   is   superb .
116666855	14621	4.0	funny   film .    mike   myers   and   eddy   murphy   are   great .

835542219	11165	4.0	i   really   don ['] t   know   what   to   make   of   this   one .    this   is   one   of   the   most   artistically   brilliant   movies   i ['] ve   ever   seen ,    but   it ['] s   incredibly   slow   and   difficult   to   get   into   until   it   gets   going ,     ( which   takes   about   an   hour   of   spaceships   floating   around   to   classical   music   or   black   screen   with   dissonant   tones   blaring   in   your   ears .  .  .    or   monkeys .    yeah .    monkeys .  )
835542219	1865	5.0	conceptually ,    the   single   best   movie   ever .    there   is   nothing   quite   like   the   idea   and   questions   that   drive   this   movie .    and   let ['] s   not   forget   jim   carrey ['] s   total   departure   from   the   norm   as   joel   barrish   and   winslet ['] s   perfect   turn   as   clementine .
835542219	10042	4.0	came   across   more   as   spielberg ['] s   excuse   to   find   brutal   and   painful   ways   to   kill   nazis   on   screen   than   the   movie   classic   everyone   makes   it   out   to   be .    but   i ['] m   not   going   to   complain   too   much .    i   hate   those   guys ,    so   i   enjoyed   it .
835542219	8806	5.0	the   3   characters   and   the   relationship   between   them   and   the   viewer   was   just   beautifully   executed .    and   ennio   morricone ['] s   score   was   amazing .
835542219	3917	5.0	zach   braff ['] s   writing / directing / acting   for   this   movie   was   really   good .    it   was   certainly   a   showcase   of   his   talents .  .  .    but   it   was   very   well   done .    i   liked   it   a   lot .
835542219	11283	5.0	this   is   without   a   doubt ,    in   my   mind ,    the   single   greatest   movie   ever   made .
835542219	963	3.5	good   jesus   christ ,    does   marlon   brando   rule .    without   his   performance ,    this   movie   is   not   much   at   all .    but   he   alone   makes   every   minute   we   have   to   listen   to   blanche ['] s   irritating   ramblings   worth   it .
835542219	14618	4.5	another   one   of   those   great   concept   movies .    jim   carrey   is   good ,    but   the   conceptual   humor   and   writing   are   what   really   make   this   fly .
835542219	15816	3.0	great   car   chase   scenes   and   a   very   good   role   for   deniro ,    but   largely   unremarkable   writing   and   a   horrible   performance   from   the   female   lead   marred   this   film   in   my   eyes .
835542219	3320	4.0	contained   some   surprisingly   good   cinematography ,    good   writing ,    a   career   performance   from   hugh   grant    ( not   saying   much ,    but   he   did   a   good   job )    and   a   soundtrack   by   one   of   my   favorite   artists .    a   very   underrated   movie .

469108318	14103	2.5	i   had   no   intention   of   ever   seeing   this ,    but   a   couple   of   friends   recommended   it ,    so   i   thought   i ['] d   give   it   a   chance .    after   all ,    it   does   have   james   garner   and   gena   rowlands   in   it ,    not   to   mention   joan   allen   and   sam   shepard ,    the   latter   two   coming   as   a   complete   surprise   to   me .    i ['] ve   loved   james   garner   from   back   in   the   support   your   local   sherriff   days ,    and   i   always   enjoyed   him   in   the   rockford   files .    and   we   all   know   joan   allen   can   do   no   wrong ,    which   gave   me   hope   that   this   wouldn ['] t   be   a   complete   waste   of   2   hours .    to   be   honest ,    it   wasn ['] t   nearly   as   bad   as   i   always   thought   it   would   be .    but   in   my   opinion ,    it ['] s   garner   and   rowlands   that   make   it   watchable ,    not   ryan   gosling   and   rachel   mcadams .    mcadams   is   ok   as   allie ,    but   i   have   problems   with   gosling ['] s   performance ,    and   gosling   in   general .    it   probably   has   something   to   do   with   the   fact   that   i   can ['] t   help   remembering   he   used   to   be   on   that   idiotic   tv   show   breaker   high .    i   just   don ['] t   agree   with   a   lot   of   reviewers   who   see   him   as   the   second   coming   of   marlon   brando ,    although   he   does   have   that   mumbling   thing   down   pat .    he   was   pretty   good   in   fracture   and   half   nelson ,    although   i   didn ['] t   think   he   deserved   an   oscar   nomination .    that   should   have   been   jack   nicholson ['] s .    he   also   has   a   tendency   to   smirk   at   inappropriate   times ,    which   makes   me   want   to   give   him   a   good   slap .    anyway ,    the   beginning   of   this   movie   definitely   stretches   the   limits   of   credulity .    ok ,    noah   falls   madly   in   love   with   allie   on   first   sight .    i   can   accept   that .    she ['] s   gorgeous .    but   here ['] s   how   he   goes   about   winning   her   heart .    first ,    he   dangles   by   one   hand   from   a   ferris   wheel ,    and   then   he   gets   her   to   lie   down   in   the   middle   of   the   street   with   him ,    which   leads   to   them   almost   getting   run   over   by   an   approaching   car .    smooth !    but   the   crazy   thing   is ,    it   actually   works .    before   you   know   it ,    she ['] s   also   madly   in   love   with   him !    i ['] m   sorry ,    but   i   don ['] t   buy   it .    if   i   was   her ,    i   would   be   getting   as   far   away   from   that   maniac   as   i   possibly   could .    but   then   there   would   have   been   no   movie ,    so   on   we   go .    it ['] s   pretty   standard   romance   novel   stuff .    girl ['] s   parents   forbid   her   to   see   boy   from   wrong   side   of   tracks ,    girl   and   boy   fight ,    they   break   up ,    she   moves   away ,    he   goes   off   to   war ,    loses   his   best   friend ,    becomes   a   man ,    returns   home ,    eventually   boy   and   girl   get   back   together ,    and   so   on ,    and   so   on .    it ['] s   not   terrible ,    but   it ['] s   really   nothing   special   either .    and   i   really   think   the   story   could   have   been   written   better .    there ['] s   a   point   in   the   film   where   garner   calls   rowlands   allie   for   the   first   time ,    and   then   we   see   their   children ,    and   they ['] re   calling   him   dad   and   her   mom .    at   that   point ,    we   know   they   got   married   and   had   kids ,    which   took   away   some   of   the   mystery   for   me .    i   have   to   admit   there   were   a   few   scenes   that   got   to   me ,    though .    particularly   the   scene   where   noah   tells   allie   that   he   wrote   her   all   those   letters ,    and   also   when   she   returns   to   find   that   he ['] s   renovated   the   old   house   exactly   as   she   had   described   it .    i   do   have   a   heart ,    i   guess .    but   overall ,    not   really   my   kind   of   movie ,    and   at   no   time   while   watching   it   did   i   believe   that   ryan   gosling   could   ever   have   transformed   himself   into   james   garner ,    no   matter   how   old   he   got !

821471492	2776	4.5	a   bit   slow   paced   at   times   but   a   well   crafted   story .
821471492	8160	2.0	tolerable   for   jamie   lee   curtis   but   the   rest   is   just   typical   slasher   film   stuff .
821471492	1102	1.0	the    " style "    may   have   won   performance   awards ,    but   the   story   lacked   the    " substance "    to   make   me   interested .       the   hero ['] s   dumb   mistakes   needed   to   propel   the   action   made   it   hard   to   understand   how   he   earned   a   badge   much   less   a   promotion .
821471492	3161	3.0	the   opening    " exorcist "    parody   is   the   best   part   of   this   film   and   the   best   reason   to   see   it .       the   rest   is   just   o . k .
821471492	7899	3.5	the   devito - schwarzenegger   chemistry   saves   a   mediocre   film .
821471492	16765	4.0	when   woo   is   at   his   best ,    reality   takes   a   back   seat .  .  . and   you   don ['] t   care .
821471492	8072	0.5	too   much   style   over   substance    ( common   of   hollywood   films )    but   it   was   the   ending   that   truly   killed   this   film   for   me .
821471492	1945	0.5	looks   good   but   based   on   the   dumbest   of   all   the   ripper   theories .       the   hughes   do   a   great   job   recreating   the   crime   scenes   but   failed   to   learn   about   the   crimes   or   the   people   and   places   involved .       same   goes   for   the   author   of   the   graphic   novel   that   was   the   bases   of   the   film .
821471492	5897	3.5	sequel   that   makes   up   for   the   poor   ending   of   the   original .
821471492	6085	5.0	in   a   league   of   it ['] s   own .       i   can ['] t   say   enough   good   things   about   this   film .       creepy   even   by   today ['] s   standards .
821471492	7511	4.0	rarely   does   an   actor   and   role   match   up   so   well .       snipes   easily   carries   the   role   through   two   more   films .
821471492	16377	5.0	great   film   with   a   great   cast   and   a   stand   out   performance   by   michael   clarke   duncan .
821471492	4310	5.0	i   was   not   a   big   fan   of   the   chucky   films   but   this   one   was   great .

73273385	11149	1.0	hmm   what   can   i   say .  .    how   about   fucking   awful ?
73273385	11443	1.0	dear   jk   rowling , as   a   huge   fan   of   the   harry   potter   books ,    i   would   just   like   to   ask .  .    if   the   characters   in   the   film   are   exactly   as   you   imagined   them   in   the   books ,    why   didn ['] t   you   describe   them   as   such ?    sell   out .
73273385	14691	5.0	amazing ,    shame   about   the   sequels .
73273385	7048	1.0	oh   frankie   muniz .  .  .    what   were   you   thinking ?  !
73273385	6556	1.0	this   would   insult   shakespeare   himself .
73273385	8989	1.0	excuse   me   while   i   vomit   all   over   the   screen .
73273385	10928	1.0	oh   for   god ['] s   sake .
73273385	15063	1.0	if   this   was   called    " black   chicks "    and   about   white   men   in   drag   as   black   women ,    there   would   have   been   riots .    when   will   those   yanks   grow   up ?
73273385	17479	2.0	the   japanese   original   was   far   superior .
633856536	9756	4.0	adam   has   done   it   again ,    a   good   movie .
633856536	13673	5.0	tom   hanks    &    tim   allen .  .  .  . a   lethal   combination !

116388999	3287	5.0	it   ended   the   only   way   that   it   could .    glad   to   see   it   was   not   another   sappy   hollywood   ending .
116388999	10429	3.0	it   amazes   me   how   many   ways   they   come   up   with   to   kill   people .
116388999	9960	4.0	great   action   flick
116388999	673	5.0	if   you   have   seen   this   film   and   think   its   about   guys   beating   each   other   up ,    you   were   not   paying   attention .

780491349	5967	3.5	i   saw   this   opening   night   with   a   then - nine   year   old   for   whom   i   used   to   babysit .       we   dressed   up   like   lizzie   and   miranda .       the   movie   itself   doesn ['] t   deserve   my   rating ,    but   my   experience   with   it   and   the   happy   feeling   i   get   when   i   think   about   it   do .
780491349	16340	0.5	i   can   forgive   hilary   duff   for   doing   this   movie   because   she   was   so   young   and   didn ['] t   know   any   better    ( and   because   she   really   wasn ['] t   any   better   of   an   actor   than   the   script   was   a   script )  ,    but -  - c ['] mon -  - cathy   moriarty ,    terri   garr ,    and   shelley   duvall ?       were   they   really   that   hard   up   for   money ?       the   story   doesn ['] t   even      make   sense .

780491349	15205	3.5	as   a   parody ,    this   is   one   of   the   best   films   in   recent   memory .       taken   at   face - value ,    i   would   give   it   many   fewer   stars .
780491349	11234	2.0	i   couldn ['] t   separate   this   from    _ owen   meany ,  _    so   it   might   be   a   fine   film ,    but   i   was   disappointed   because   i   kept   expecting   more   of   the    _ owen   meany _    story   to   creep   in .
780491349	14482	4.5	i   jumped   on   this   train   kinda   late ,    but   i ['] ve   fallen   for   it .       brad   pitt   was   fabulous .       i ['] m   constantly   surprised   by   the   fact   that   brad ['] s   good .
780491349	2590	4.5	i   hated   this   when   i   was   younger ,    but   have   inexplicably   fallen   in   love   with   it   over   the   past   few   years .

781899228	1905	4.5	['] the   curse   of   the   black   pearl [']    was   a   really   fun   movie   to   watch .    it   kept   me   at   the   edge   of   my   seat   and   it   had   great   humor   in   it .    johnny   depp   was   perfect   for   jack   sparrow !
781899228	12130	3.5	sick   and   twisted . not   sure   what   there   is   to   get   about   this   movie .    the   mutant   baby   scenes   were   very   frightening   and   surreal .    and   that ['] s   what   david   lynch ['] s   movies   are   about ,    surrealness .
781899228	14671	4.5	what   to   say   about   this   movie ?    this   movie   has   top - notch   acting .    bruno   ganz ['] s   portrayal   of   hitler   was   spectacular .    it   was   very   interesting   to   see   the   real   story   from   the   point   of   view   of   hitler ['] s   final   secretary .    the   fact   that   all   the   dialogue   was   pretty   much   accurate   really   made   me   feel   like   i   was   there .    from   the   moment   hitler   was   confident   in   what   he   was   doing   to   the   moment   where   he   slowly   was   losing   his   hope .    the   rise   and   fall   of   adolf   hitler .
781899228	10627	4.5	my   all - time   favourite   zombie   movie .    it   had   such   a   lot   of   charm .    the   movie   was   very   upbeat   at   some   times    ( which   i   really   liked )  .  .    yet   it   still   gory   and   tense .    it   was   a   nice   mix .
781899228	16969	4.0	i   loved   the   music   from   this   movie .    this   was   one   twisted   and   weird   movie .    however   the   ending   can   be   interpreted   in   many   ways .
781899228	17181	3.5	this   was   an   alright   movie ,    but   definitely   not   one   of   my   favourite   zombie   movies . the   midget - shootout   scene   was   priceless .
781899228	13610	3.5	yeah   it   was   pretty   good .  .    and   this   is   coming   from   a   big - time   spider - man   fan &  # 9829 ;  .  .    well   not   that   big !
781899228	4384	4.0	i   thought   this   movie   would   be   a   lame   remake .    but   i   am   no   fan   of   remakes .    but   i   have   heard   a   lot   of   things   about   this   movie .    and   loving   the   original    " dawn   of   the   dead "  ,    i   gave   it   a   shot .    i   liked   the   movie ,    it   was   a   differently   take   on   being   stuck   on   in   a   mall   surrounded   by   zombies .    it   is   nowhere   near   as   a   good   as   dawn   of   the   dead   but   it   was   still   quite   entertaining .
781899228	4829	4.0	this   movie   was   quite   funny .    but   i   thought   it   would   be   a    * little *    funnier ,    judging   my   the   trailers .    i   was   still   entertained   though .
781899228	2463	3.5	i   was   a   little   disappointed   with   this   movie .    i   thought   it   was   a   little   on   the   overrated   side .    don ['] t   get   me   wrong ,    it   was   a   nice   action - packed   comedy   with   very   nice   visuals .    but   not   my   favourite   pixar   movie .
781899228	3860	4.0	steve   carrel ['] s   scene   towards   the   end   alone   made   me   love   this   movie   even   more .    and   i   totally   love   that    " it ['] s   a   wonderful   life "    reference !     : p
781899228	15532	3.5	as   a   kid ,    i   always   thought   that   this   was   the   ultimate   chic   flick .    probably   because   i   was   addicted   that    " kiss   me "    song ,    and   i   had   a   crush   on   rachael   leigh   cook   at   the   time ,    and   i   liked   the   plot .    and   freddie   prinze   jr .    is   just   awesome   haha .    even   though   it   is   cliched ,    it   is   still   nostalgic   to   me .
781899228	6886	4.5	the   music ,    the   characters ,    the   storyline ,    all   great .    my   heart   was   beating   fast   when   i   watched   the   ending .    near   the   end   of   the   movie   i   really   started   to   care   about   the   characters   and   the   choices   they   would   make   even   more .    eva   green   was   also   very   beautiful   in   this   and   she   had   lots   of   charm . michael   pitt ['] s    " hey   joe "    is   one   of   the   best   covers   i   have   ever   heard .
781899228	5991	5.0	one   of   my   favourite   movies .    everyone   was   rightly   casted   in   this   movie .    i   can   not   wait   for    " sin   city   2 "  .    mickey   rouke   was   outstanding   and   hilarious .    bruce   willis   was   bad - ass .    and   clive   owen   was   slicker   than   ever ,    he   is   soo   cool !    elijah   wood   was   devilishly   freaky .    benicio   del   toro   fit   the   part   very   well .  .    but   then   again ,    he   is   perfect   in   all   his   movies !    i   could   go   on   and   on   about   this   movie .    i   also   loved   how   much   it   stayed   true   to   the   graphic   novels

"       ingrid   is   so   damn   beautiful ,    even   though   i   had   zero   respect   for   her   ilse .       dooley   wilson   had   an   eminently   appealing   presence   and   listenable   voice   as   sam ,    and   claude   rains   was   perfect   in   support   of   bogart .

240435883	2617	5.0	i   love   this !    ron   eldard   and   the   evil   dude   are   hot .    i   like   how   it   all   happens   in   one   place   instead   of   say .  .  .    around   an   entire   city .    it   adds   to   the   scare   that   there   is   no   escape .    cool .
240435883	11421	5.0	now   this   is   one   freaky   film ,    and   i   made   the   mistake   of   watching   it   on   my   own !    at   first   i   almost   mistook   it   for   a   romantic   film   but   the   changes   to   the   story   thoroughly   confused   me   but   kept   my   eyes   glued   to   the   screen .    a   sick   and   twisted   film   but   it   was   amazing   to   watch ,    i ['] ve   never   seen   anything   like   it .    ever .

240435883	13610	5.0	i   believe   far   better   than   the   first   movie ,    the   visual   effects   are   stunning   and   with   a   more   frightening   enemy ,    maybe   more   frightening   because   he   is   driven   by   the   technology   that   he   created   himself .    we   have   thrills ,    suspense ,    romance   and   non - stop   action   rolled   into   one   film ,    i   love   it .
240435883	15471	4.0	a   must - see   thriller .    keifer   sutherland ['] s   voice   is   haunting   from   start   to   finish .    it   amkes   it   more   thrilling   that   we   cannot   see   the   bad   guy .    i ['] m   not   a   fan   of   colin   farrell   but   his   performance   is   nothing   but   perfect .    he   can   bring   so   much   drama   to   that   one   small   space .    cool   film .
240435883	7397	3.0	now   this   is   one   freaky   film ,    how   much   would   somebody   pay   to   see   robin   williams   dressed   up   as   a   woman ?    however   although   a   strange   thing   to   do ,    he   plays   this   role   with   so   much   comedy .    it ['] s   definately   one   i   could   watch   again .
240435883	12546	3.0	a   fun   film   to   watch   occasionally   but   it   doesn ['] t   blow   me   away .    i   only   love   to   watch   two   grown   men   getting   their   ass ['] s   wupped   by   a   boy .
240435883	6972	5.0	i   love   this   film   so   much .    such   a   beautiful   cast   they   chose ,    and   quite   rightly   too ,    they   all   seem   to   play   the   characters   with   such   ease .    bruce   willis ,    steve   buscemi ,    ben   affleck ,    so   many   great   actors   thrown   into   one   space   shuttle .    how   can   you   say   no   to   this ?    parts   of   the   film   become   very   tearful ,    but   thats   just   what   every   film   needs   right ?    definately   a   winner   in   my   books .
240435883	10739	3.0	nothing   makes   me   shudder   more   than   the   thought   of   leo   decaprio   with   long   hair .    but   anyway ,    its   a   nice   film ,    not   spectacular   but   with   a   charming   cast   especially   john   malcovich ,    i   think   he   is   excellent   in   every   role   he   plays .
240435883	3579	2.0	maybe   not   for   everyone ,    car   lovers   would   kill   to   see   this   film .    very   fast - paced   action ,    takes   me   a   few   times   to   keep   up   with   the   plot .
240435883	3079	3.0	another   children ['] s   classic .    sad   moments   and   happy   moments   but   all   in   all   a   great   film   to   see .

( spoilers   down   below ) for   william   munny ,    however ,    it ['] s   a   little   different .    after   ned   is   killed   on   his   way   home   after   realizing   he   doesn ['] t   have   what   it   takes   to   kill   anymore ,    he   himself   is   murdered   by   little   bill ['] s   men .    will   becomes   enraged   and   breaks   his   ten   year   sobriety   vow    ( another ,    albeit   smaller ,    parallel   to   tdkr )    and   takes   a   drink   before   making   his   way   back   to   big   whiskey   to   take   down   the   men   who   murdered   ned .    once   he   has   disposed   of   little   bill   and   his   posse ,    he   states   that   he   will   return   should   any   harm   come   to   the   prostitutes   and   that   they   should   bury   his   friend   ned   with   the   proper   respect .    after   this ,    it   is   assumed   william   returns   to   his   peaceful   life   with   his   two   children .    as   i   mentioned   above ,    what   i   like   about   this   film   is   the   moral   ambiguity .    william   munny   may   be   the   protagonist   and   he   may   be   fighting   for   a   noble   cause   but   in   his   past ,    he   was   apparently   a   horrible   man   to   have   known    ( his   wife   must   have   been   some   influence   on   him   if   she   tamed   the   beast   within ) little   bill ,    again ,    see   above ,    is   by   no   means   a   one   dimensional   villain . this   all   ties   in   well   with   the   overall   theme   of   the   movie ,    which   is   stated   by   munny :     " we   all   have   it   coming ,    kid " it   should   be   noted   it   was   also   not   an   attempt   to   make   an   anti - violence   film ,    that   came   about   on   its   own . oddly   enough ,    i   am   a   fan   of   the   man   with   no   name / dollars   trilogy ,    which ,    while   leaps   and   bounds   ahead   of   most   westerns ,    is   less   about   violence   begetting   violence .    but   i   still   have   this   film   to   thank   for   trying   something   different .     ( one   last   note ,    about   tdkr   relations ,    an   amusing   thing   here   is   that   if   it   were   to   be   filmed ,    eastwood   was   always   the   first   man   i   had   in   mind   to   be   the   caped   crusader .    perhaps   this   is   a    " spiritual   prequel "  ?  )

425060015	1046	3.0	entertaining   enough .    i   don ['] t   like   brittany   murphy   but   dakota   fanning   is   brilliant   actress .

795867383	17308	3.0	reese   witherspoon   is   cute .  .  .    i   guess   the   movie ,    being   a   chick   flick ,    wasn ['] t   so   bad   for   me   either .       way   better   than   the   sequel .
795867383	197	3.5	the   love   scene   toward   the   end   was   one   of   the   hottest   i ['] ve   seen !
795867383	3638	1.5	good   actions   alone   does   not   make   a   movie   good ,    and   here   is   a   good   example .       idiotic   dialogues   with   plots   that   existed   only   for   the   actions .       bad   movie ,    but   yes   it   had   some   funny   moments   as   well .  .  .    just   not   enough   to   turn   it   into   a   good   movie .
795867383	9728	3.5	i   know   this   is   one   of   the   classics   and   all   the   great   reviews   of   this   film ,    but   i   just   didn ['] t   quite   feel   it   when   i   saw   it   the   first   time .       recently   saw   it   again   and   liked   it   a   lot   more .       how   should   i   put   it .  .  .    hmm ,    i   finally    " felt "    it .

795867383	12092	0.5	the   only   highlight   was   alicia   silverstone .  .  .    and   she ['] s   horrible   in   this   film   as   well .
795867383	1324	4.5	it   is   a   good   movie !
795867383	11886	3.0	this   was   another   movie   i   saw   when   i   first   came   to   the   states .       i   know   i   really   liked   it ,    but   i   have   not   gotten   the   chance   to   watch   it   again   so   i   don ['] t   know   if   i   still   do .  .  .    but   hey ,    first   impression   counts !
795867383	3624	4.0	i   didn ['] t   like   it   when   i   saw   it   in   the   theater ,    but   i   recently   saw   it   on   tv   and   somehow   i   was   quite   impressed   with   it   and   had   to   finish   it .       gave   it   4   star   solely   on   my   impression   years   later   watching   the   rerun   on   tv .

795867383	3347	4.0	jessica   alba   was   so   hot   in   this   movie   that   she   made   this   movie   more   attractive   than   what   it   really   was .
795867383	10673	3.5	my   dad   and   i   couldn ['] t   stop   laughing   when   we   first   saw   the   cover   of   the   vhs   cover   at   the   rental   store   back   in   1992 .

462842890	12074	3.5	an   enjoyable ,    lighthearted   musical .
462842890	10198	2.0	needless   follow   up   to   the   average   first   film .
462842890	4949	0.5	i   threw   not   only   popcorn   at   the   screen ,    but   every   curse   known   to   man .    this   is   a   putrid ,    scareless ,    downright   confusing   and   offensively   stupid   remake .
462842890	13315	4.0	a   great   adaptation ,    even   if   a   little   overlong .
462842890	10627	4.0	wahey ,    i   wasn ['] t   expecting   this   to   be   that   good !    i   like   surprises ,    this   is   action   packed ,    well   acted   and   bloody   good   fun .
462842890	3938	4.0	just   as   good   as   the   original ,    this   is   a   fun ,    inventive   and   often   hilarious   delight .
462842890	13512	3.5	the   one   that   started   it   all   off   is   still   a   guilty   delight   after   all   these   years .

462842890	10583	3.5	this   is   actually   a   pretty   entertaining ,    good   natured   comedy .
462842890	8512	3.5	positives ?    better   plot   and   villain   that   tnd ,    but   just   as   much   exciting   action .    the   negatives ?    denise   richards ,    ocassionally   pedstrian   direction   and   a   weak   finale .    decent   bond   though .

462842890	16879	2.0	an   overated ,    overblown ,    monotonous   experience
462842890	6287	4.0	as   far   as   cheesiness   goes ,    this   may   be   finest   cheddar ,    but   it ['] s   classy ,    moving ,    funny   and   doesn ['] t   insult   your   intelligence .    a   modern   fairytale .
462842890	7032	3.0	more   of   the   same   and   the   jokes   are   cruder   this   time .    but   as   entertainment ,    it   suceeds   in   making   you   laugh   hysterically .
462842890	9886	3.5	i   can ['] t   diss   the   phantom    -    it ['] s   the   first   star   wars   film   i   ever   saw    -    the   moment   i      beheld   those   lightsabers ,    i   was   hooked .

784119339	5317	4.5	love   this   it   was   so   funny   i   was   still   laughing   all   the   way   through .    the   second   one   was   bad   though .
784119339	17405	4.0	although   the   plot   was   staight   forward   and   i   like   movies   based   on   books   or   with   alaborate   plots   i   loved   this   movie .
784119339	17169	4.5	the   nationlal   treasure   movie   was   a   great   movie   and   i   have   watched   it   a   lot   and   i   am   still   entertained   by   it .    it   was   a   great   movie   because   of   the   plot   and   actors / actresses .
784119339	17308	4.5	this   is   one   of   my   favorite   movies   just   because   it   is   so   funny !    stereotypical   blond   e   humor   with   a   new   twist .    it   is   taken   very   lightly
784119339	7032	3.0	it   was   okay .    the   comedy   like   in   all   austin   powers   movies   is   a   little   much   but   it   was   okay .
784119339	8079	5.0	it   was   written   well   and   stayed   true   to   the   book .    although   i   don ['] t   see   why   later   they   skip   with   the   movies   to   the   last   book   in   the   vampire   anne   rice   quartet
784119339	4341	4.5	very   good   action   movie   that   actually   had   a   plot   and   it   was   very   entertaining   because   of   the   setting   and   sfx   too .
784119339	14621	4.0	this   movie   was   the   best   original   idea   of   the   year   for   disney   it   rocks !
784119339	14712	4.5	this   apart   from   having   female .  .  .    in   it   which   i   didnt   much   care   for   it   had   a   plot   a   female   action   flick   with   a   plot !  !  !
784119339	329	5.0	it   is   a   classic   good   versus   evil   movie   with   a   few   new   twists   in   the   plot .    wonderfully   done .    it   was   brilliant   film   work   amd   the   script   was   written   very   well

134920595	7032	3.0	this   is   a   good   movie .    i   also   like   all   the   other   austin   powers   movies .    plus ,    i   think   that   it   is   so   funny   and   neat   that   mick   myers   plays   so   many   characters   in   each   movie .
134920595	5239	3.0	i   liked   this   movie .    it   was   hilarious ,    but   that   is   partly   because   adam   sandler   is   in   it .    plus ,    i   thought   it   was   cool   that   nelly   was   in   it .
134920595	14103	5.0	i   read   the   book   that   goes   with   this   movie ,    and   i   usually   end   up   thinking   that   the   book   was   better   than   the   movie .    but   it   turns   out   that   i   thought   the   movie   was   just   as   good   as   the   book .
134920595	15063	5.0	i   think   that   this   movie   is   down   right   funny .    what   else   can   i   say .
134920595	6235	5.0	i   love   this   movie .    it   was   so   good ,    but   really   sad   at   the   end .
134920595	1962	4.0	i   thought   that   this   movie   was   good ,    but   sad .
469250990	13610	2.5	this   one   was   good   by   itself .    it   didn ['] t   need    " ii "    to   help   it   any .

202829854	17499	3.0	not   the   best   disney   movie   of   all   time   but   visually ,    is   nice .    it   gives   the   viewer   good   insite   into   the   hardships   of   other   cultures   while   still   keeping   a   light   comedic   tone   making   sure   that   the   viewer   doesn ['] t   lose   interest .    not   on   my   top   10   disney   list   but   still   worth   watching .
202829854	3962	4.0	how   can   you   not   want   to   watch   this   movie ?    it ['] s   awesome .    i ['] ll   lend   it   to   you   sometime .
202829854	1975	2.5	this   movie   is   painfully   average .    kevin   bacon   hasnt [']    made   a   great   movie   in   a   really   long   time   and   it   looks   like   we ['] re   going   to   wait   a   while   longer   to   see   him   come   out   of   his   slump .    i   do   kind   of   like   the   premise   and   it ['] s   executed   alright .    the   movie   could   have   been   better .    you ['] re   not   missing   much .
202829854	17295	4.5	the   best   comedy   jim   carrey   has   ever   put   up    -    followed   closely   with   bruce   almighty .    true ,    some   of   the   jokes   are   raunchy ,    but   the   movie   as   a   whole   has   a   great   feel .    there   are   a   lof   of   elements   mixed   into   this   movie .    great ,    creative   approach   to   the   theme   with   impressive   execution .
202829854	6497	3.0	pretty   good   mystery / thriller .    sandra   bullock   in   her   typical   tomboy   role    -    this   time   as   a   cop .    she ['] s   played   better   roles   but   the   supporting   cast   does   a   great   job .    ryan   gosling   is   very   convincing .    not   a   great   movie   but   i   still   recommend   it .
202829854	5862	3.5	most   movies   told   backwards   are   really   fucking   annoying   but   this   one   has   a   great   appeal   and   wouldn ['] t   be   the   same   if   it   weren ['] t   told   in   such   a   way .    fans   of   carrie   ann   moss   won ['] t   be   disappointed   and   guy   pearce   is   great   as   the   lead .    standout   performance   by   joey    " pants "    pantoliano .    the   movie   leaves   you   feeling   frustrated   and   wish   that   things   would   have   worked   out   better .    great   movie .
202829854	16469	2.0	what   happens   when   you   put   two   blockbuster   classics   together   in   one   film    ( based   of   a   video   game   i   might   add )  ?    nothing .    well   at   least   nothing   all   that   enjoyable .    although   it ['] s   pretty   much   what   you ['] d   expect    ( a   high   impact ,    intensified   thriller / action   flick )  ,    you   always   hope   that   there ['] s   more .    i   know   that   most   people   going   to   see   this   movie   are   into   the   visual   effects   and   action   sequences   but .  . they ['] ve   been   done   before .    not   only   have   they   been   done   before ,    you ['] re   talking   about   the   same   80s   and   early   90s   visual   effects   as   the   originals .    it   was   revolutionary   for   the   time ,    which   was   a   major   reason   why   the   originals   were   so   successful ,    but   todays [']    standards   demand   a   lot   more .    that   being   said ,    the   story   itself   had   more   depth   than   you ['] d   think .    if   you ['] ve   played   the   game   before    ( which   i   haven ['] t )  ,    then   it   probably   all   makes   sense   and   the   story   was   based   on   what   you   thought   it   would .    there   are   much   better   and   more   original   out   there   so   i   wouldn ['] t   recommend   this   movie .
202829854	11152	4.5	this   movie   definitely   hits   my   top   10 .
202829854	16969	4.0	agreed .    this   movie   fucking   rocks .    if   you   haven ['] t   seen   it   and   you   feel   like    " thinking "    about   a   movie   rather   than   just   watching   one    -    this   is   a   good   movie   for   you .    eventhough   jake   is   awesome   in   this   movie    -    i   really   think   jenna   malone   takes   the   spotlight .    she ['] s   preferct   as   a   supporting   actress   and   i   really   look   forward   to   her   future   endeavors .    highly   recommended .
202829854	12471	3.0	much   better   than   i   thought   it   was   going   to   be .    i ['] m   surprised   eminem   is   a   half   way   decent   actor    -    even   though   he   was   really   just   playing   himself .    brittany   murphy   played   very   well   along   side   of   him   and   they   had   good   chemistry .    all   in   all ,    i ['] d   recommend   the   movie   though   i   think   that   if   you   go   in   with   low   expectations   you ['] ll   be   happier   after   than   if   you   went   in   hoping   to   see   a   classic .

351731887	4384	3.0	an   alright   thrill   fest ,    although   not   in   the   same   league   as   the   original .    lacking   the   charm   and   majesty   of   the   original ,    this   film   nevertheless   was   a   faithful   enough   remake .    the   attempt   to   generate   new   fear   by   having   running   zombies   was   a   commendable ,    if   poorly   executed ,    idea .    seeming   all   too   much   like   a   blatant   attempt   at   copying   28   days   later ,    this   movie   lost   its   magic   half   way   through .    however ,    al   in   all ,    it   was   an   enjoyable   zombie   romp   that   created   true   fear   for   all   who   viewed   it .    it   tried   to   bring   something   new   to   the   tired   zombie   genre   and   in   doing   so ,    it   both   reinvented   the   zombie   genre   and   also   missed   the   point   completely .    had   this   film   not   been   called   dawn   of   the   dead ,    it   may   have   generate   more   popularity   as   a   seperate   zombie   title .    as   it   happens ,    it   is   a   poor   attempt   as   recreating   a   classic   movie .    whereas   the   original   still   maintains   its   charm ,    this   one   will   surely   age   as   it   has   nothing   new   other   than   better   effects .    an   enjoyable   enough   experience ,    but   not   in   the   same   league   as   the   original .

351731887	3813	3.5	well ,    the   first   one   is   good ,    but   this   is   better .    if   you   like   action ,    it   certainly   has   more   than   the   first   in   it .    if   you   like   gore ,    it ['] s   got   that   too .    also ,    the   only   time   blade   ever   seems   to   fall   in   love ,    with   a   vampire !    how   ironic .    there   are   flaws   to   the   plot ,    but   the   action   makes   u   for   it .    enjoyed   the   first   more   though ,    and   bringing   whistler   back   is   just   not   right ,    and   doesn ['] t   fit   the   story .    overall   though ,    it ['] s   an   enjoyable   return !
351731887	7511	4.0	this   is   where   it   started .    arguably   my   favourite   movie   trilogy   in   history   started   here ,    and   my   was   it   a   start .    from   the   opening   fight   scene ,    it   was   made   very   clear   that   this   film   wasn ['] t   trying   to   be   clever .    it   wasn ['] t   pushing   boundaries -    it   was   just   an   action   film   meant   for   enjoyment .    as   it   happens ,    this   worked   out   fine .    the   plot   isn ['] t   that   hard   to   understand ,    basic   bad   guy / good   guy   scenario ,    but   what   saves   it   are   the   opening   and   ending   fight .    in   a   time   when   the   matrix   hadn ['] t   quite   raised   its   head   yet ,    this   film   was   the   essence   of   cool .    the   sfx   at   times   leave   much   to   be   desired ,    but   are   largely   effective .    however ,    looking   at   a   film   from   1998   with   a   budget   like   this   movie   had   suddenly   makes   you   realised   what   a   great   job   they   did   with   this   creation .    it   had   some   amazing   fight   scenes ,    and   a   cheesy   sense   of   cool   oozing   throughout   it .    this   comic   book   adaptation   hit   the   spot   and   stayed   there !
351731887	16377	4.0	i   have   only   ever   cried   in   two   films ,    coincedentally   both   of   them   starring   tom   hanks .    first   up ,    the   ending   of   forrest   gump .    secondly ,    the   ending   of   this   film .    there   is   no   scene   in   film   history   i   can   think   that   was   better   directed   than   the   electricution   of   john   coffey    ( like   the   drink   only   not   spelt   the   same .    not   only   is   it   a   touching   film   with   truly   moving   moments ,    but   it   hides   a   deep   and   meaningful   moral   behind   it .    michael   clarke   duncan   is   truly   amazing   in   it ,    and   the   supporting   cast   are   also   very   strong .    if   you   can   watch   the   end   few   scenes   without   shedding   a   tear   than   you   are   not   human   in   my   opinion ,    as   even   i   was   in   tears   and   i ['] m   not   the   crying   sort !

351731887	6428	4.0	after   studying   the   book   of   this   for   gcse ,    my   curiosity   overwhelmed   and   i   simply   had   to   watch   the   film   and   i   was   pleasantly   surprised .    i   enjoyed   the   book   and   now   the   film ,    especially   how   it   portrays   injustice   and   racism   and   the   way   that   humankind   lacks   courage   to   stand   up   for   what   is   right .    gregory   peck   is   truly   outstanding   as   atticus   finch ,    the   lawyer   put   onto   a   losing   case   by   having   to   defend   a   negro   in   1930s   america   all   the   way   to   death   row .    it   is   filmed   in   black   and   white ,    but   this   adds   to   its    ? old ?    feel   and   is   also   quite   fitting   for   the   social   divide   in   the   film   between   black   and   white .    whilst   harper   lee ? s   novel   is   good ,    the   movie   gives   a   face   to   the   name   of   tom   robinson   and   truly   makes   you   want   to   cry .    although   i   managed   to   stifle   the   tears ,    this   movie   is   beyond   mere   entertainment   and   truly   affects   the   emotions   of   the   viewer .    for   a   film   of   its   age ,    it   is   truly   a   masterpiece   that   deserves   much   more   recognition   in   the   current   day   and   age .

396221590	5705	2.5	bra   film   men   här   är   det   ett   steg   tillbaka   och   den   håller   definitivt   inte   samma   klass   som   de   andra   filmerna .
396221590	2913	3.0	riktigt   konstverk ,    både   johnny   depp   och   kate   winslet   är   skitbra   skådespelare

290895434	7521	2.5	some   funny   gags ,    but   in   general   its   a   plottless   satire   film   and   not   a   very   good   one   at   that .

290895434	17560	4.0	an   80s   adventure / comedy   classic .  .    jokes   work   every   time   you   watch   it   and   the   movie   is   always   just   as   fun .
290895434	331	4.5	kevin   smith   stretches   his   writing   wings   a   bit   with   this   heart   felt   lost - love   story .    still   true   to   his   raunchy   humor   this   movie   also   brings   a   heart   wrenching   element   that   cannot   be   faked .
290895434	14203	1.5	the   begining   of   the   end   of   the   original   batman   franchise .  .    a   few   asthetic   gems   but   in   all   its   campy   hollywood   crap .  . burton   did   it   best
290895434	985	3.0	a   decent   action   adventure   film   and   one   opf   the   last   of   its   kind   till   the   pirates   movies .  .    some   stuff   seems   a   little   half   thought   and   campy   at   times .  .    but   the   movie   works   ok .  .
290895434	10730	4.0	liked   this   one   allot .  .       acting   alone   makes   it   a   must   watch .  .
290895434	15205	2.5	stupid   plot .  .    good   acting   and   nice   special   effects   dont   make   up   for   it   either .  .  .
290895434	2782	3.5	dont   remember   this   movie   that   well .  .    but   it   seemed   cool
290895434	17308	3.5	a   cute   movie   that   has   allot   of   re - watch   value   but   its   mindless   brain   candy .  .
290895434	312	4.5	a   movie   that   any   music   geek   needs   in   his / her   collection .    this   movie   is   the   perfect   romance   from   a   guys   point - of - view .
290895434	14670	5.0	tim   burton   creates   the   best   best   batman   adaptation   to   date   with   great   acting   and   wonderful   sets .
290895434	16438	4.0	my   personal   fav   of   the   sandler   movies .  .    a   romantic   comedy   at   heart ,    this   movie   works   in   the   same    " when   harry   met   sally "    way .  .  .    friends   become   lovers .  . truly   a   fictional   tale .
290895434	9756	3.0	better   than   some   of   the   later   sandler   flicks   but   the   direction   of   this   movie   seemed   kind   of   flat   compared   to   the   some - what   funny   script .  . also   could   have   been   a   little   re - casted .  .
290895434	14538	3.0	not   the   best   chick   flick   ever   made , but   very   watchable   at   the   same   time .    more / better   dialauge   would   have   made   it   a   four   star   movie .
290895434	6690	4.5	a   wonderfully   quirky   dramedy   from   the   man   who   brought   you   rushmore .    anderson   makes   his   perfect   movie   with   a   star   studded   cast   that   actually   works !
290895434	6972	3.0	fun   disaster   flick ,    but   very   unrealistic .  . like   many   in   this   genre .  .    also   a   little   corny   and   mushy   at   times .  .
290895434	10282	2.5	not   perfect   by   any   means    .  . but   more   fun   than   people   give   it   credit   for .
290895434	5991	5.0	visual   masterpeice   and   pulpy   fodder   for   comic   geeks   like   me !    the   culmination   of   neo - nior
290895434	12497	3.5	surprisingly   not   that   bad !    not   amazing   by   any   means ,    but   an   entertaining   teen   flick   with   just   enough   sas    ( not   to   mention   hot   chearleaders )    to   keep   it   fun !    doesn ['] t   take   itself   too   seriously .    ocasionally   shallow   though .

228421185	7664	5.0	i   don ['] t   like   it   as   much   as   my   ratings   seem   to   indicate   but   it   was   pretty   damn   sweet   from   what   i   can   remember .
228421185	10928	2.5	i   really   don ['] t   remember   much   of   it .

814008273	2594	3.0	ya   know ? cute   enough   for   a   movie   about   talking   sperm   and   infants .       what ? s   there   to   say ,    really .       except   maybe   that   kirstie   ally   really   packed   on   the   meat   b / n   then   and   now .
814008273	14403	2.0	i   dunno .  .  . maybe   it ['] s   just   too   corny   yet   takes   itself   seriously .       i   watched   it   while   i   played   around   on   the   internet   in   the   wee   hours   of   the   am   b / c   it   was   a   free   on   demand   movie .       these   are   pretty   much   the   only   circumstances   in   which   you   watch   this   movie .
814008273	5363	5.0	i   would   totally   be   jay ['] s   boo - boo   kitty   fuck .       the   bonus   features   on   any   kevin   smith   flick :    hilarity   ensues .
814008273	6030	5.0	i   don ? t   care   what   people   say   about    ? normal ?    actors   playing    ? special ?    people ;    this   movie ,    especially   sean   penn ,    was   amazing .       michelle   pfeiffer   and   dakota   fanning   were   perfect .       if   this   movie   doesn ? t   grab   your   heart   and   squeeze   it   and   make   you   want   to   run   out   and   be   a   better   person   you   should   follow   the   yellow   brick   road   to   ask   the   wizard   for   one .       keep   a   box   of   tissues   by   you .       oh ,    beatles   followers   will   probably   love   this   too ,    even   if   you   don ? t   like   sappy   movies .       i   loved   it ,    loved   it ,    loved   it .       the   acting ,    the   story ,    the   music .       all   of   it .
814008273	1754	4.0	i   especially   liked   this   movie   when   i   was   too   young   to   be   watching   it :    talk   about   sex ,    a   little   nudity ,    the    " f "    word .       i ['] m   actually   pretty   shocked   this   movie   is   pg .       whether   you   condone   foul   language   or   not ,    sixteen   candles   will   make   you   laugh ,    even   if   you   hated   your   high   school   years .       plus ,    it   has   that   tenderness   factor   which   gives   it   a   one - up   on   movies   like   fast   times .       we   all   had   a   jake   ryan .       the   only   thing   that   sucks   about   sixteen   candles   is   it   might   give   young   girls   the   false   hope   that   this   kind   of   stuff   actually   happens !
814008273	6337	3.0	it ['] s   what   you   expect   it   to   be .       dennis   miller   has   some   funny   lines .       it ['] s   tough   for   me   to   laugh   at   david   spade .

374696730	5223	4.0	i   can   see   why   angelina   jolie   gained   an   oscar   for   her   performance .       winona   ryder ['] s   and   brittany   murhphy ['] s      roles   were   more   understated   but   equally   intense   and   it   wasn ['] t   difficult   to   empathise   with   any   of   them .       i   don ['] t   think   it ['] s   easy   to   transfer   to   the   screen   the   depth   and   background   of   characters   that   would   have   been   portrayed   in   the   novel   but   it   was   a   good   attempt .

178430448	16879	3.5	i   thought   the   titanic   was   really   good ,    until   i   found   out   it   was   a   true   story   when   i   was   like   7 !    that ['] s   when   i   went   off   it   a   bit   but   it ['] s   really   cleverly   done   and   informative    ( lol )  .

786753488	16384	2.5	i   quite   liked   this ,    despite   its   inherent   flaws .       tommy   lee   jones   was   superb .
786753488	12355	1.0	there   are   some   interesting   ideas   in   this   movie ,    lost   beneath   spielberg ['] s   insistence   on   sentimentality .       like   minority   report   this   film   has   a   natural   ending   about   twenty   minutes   before   it   does .       worse   than   in   minority   report ,    the   last   twenty   minutes   of   this   movie   detract   from   everything   else   and   are   enough   to   make   you   vomit .
786753488	798	2.5	as   monster   movies   go ,    it ['] s   probably   one   of   the   best ,    but   it ['] s   ultimately   not   very   good .
786753488	14909	1.0	an   almost   insipid   remake   of   wings   of   desire .       some   good   photography ,    though .
786753488	12600	2.0	a   good   nostalgia   hit .       pretty   weak   story .       good   music .

786753488	8072	0.5	god   this   was   almost   the   worst   serial   killer   movie   ever .       i   only   watched   it   to   be   with   a   girl .       i   shouldn ['] t   have   bothered .       the   date   was   bad ,    this   movie   was   worse .
786753488	2897	3.0	a   better   sequel .       some   very   funny   moments   in   this .       love   the   singing .    and   mowgli   doing   his   rambo   impression   is   ace .
786753488	10583	1.0	just   not   funny .
786753488	1595	5.0	take   away   citizen   kane   and   orson   welles   is   still   a   genius    -    for   even   though   he   didn ['] t   officially   direct   this ,    his   hands   are   all   over   it .       the   best   noir   ever   made .       vienna   never   looked   so   dirty .
786753488	5582	4.0	the   best   star   wars   movie   that   almost   reaches   wagnerian   heights   at   times .       unlike   the   other   movies ,    it ['] s   not   annoying .
786753488	4551	2.0	the   better   of   guy   ritchie ['] s   films ,    with   some   very   clever   editing .       a   technical   film   more   than   anything .
786753488	758	1.5	the   only   film   lindsay   lohan   is   good   in .       the   first   film   in   which   i   saw   tina   fey ,    and   she ['] s   brill ,    and   it   actually   has   some   funny   lines .

527320209	10358	4.0	so   the   original   oceans   11   with   frank   sinatra   was   the   best .  .  .    the   remake   was   second   and   this   was   third ,    but   all   good   flicks   though .
527320209	6911	1.5	i   think   the   movie   and   the   play   is   stupid .
527320209	9049	4.5	my   favorite   paul   thomas   anderson   movie .  .  .    it   was   amazing ,    quite   simply   put .    quite   long ,    but   extraordinary   acting   and   a   wonderful   underlying    " moral "    darei   say .    i   wouldn ['] t   recommend   it   to   everyone ,    but   certainly   one   of   the   best   movies   i   have   seen   in   a   while .
