519405200	4306	2.5	creepy
158121132	6099	5.0	one   of   the   best   anti - war   movies   ever   and   one   that   will   surely   haunt   anyone   that   sees   it .
158121132	3824	5.0	one   of   my   favourite   movies .    probably   best   to   read   the   novel   first ,    although   it   is   a   very   faithful   adaption   of   the   novel .    a   very   entertaining   movie   and   sharp   social   commentary   on   the   pointlessness   of   the   american   dream   and   the   failure   of   the   60s   hippy   dream   of   chemistry - based   enlightenment .    johnny   depp ['] s   performance   is   amazing .
158121132	14869	5.0	i ['] ve   probably   seen   this   movie   more   times   than   any   other .    the   visuals   blow   me   away   every   time .    the   director ['] s   cut   is   a   big   improvement ,    the   voiceover   was   cheesy   and   the   extra   scenes   are   important   in   suggesting   that   deckard   is   a   replicant .    great   to   see   on   the   biggest   screen   possible .
158121132	14691	4.5	looking   back   on   the   movie   and   all   the   sequels   and   parodies      it ['] s   difficult   to   remember   how   stunning   it   was   on   the   first   viewing .    one   of   the   best   and   most   stylish   sci - fi   movies   ever .    they   should   have   stopped   here .
158121132	2985	3.5	there   are   some   scenes   in   this   that   really   cracked   me   up .
158121132	5226	4.5	it ['] s   hard   not   to   love   the   max   fischer   character   in   rushmore .    a   classic   wes   anderson   movie .
158121132	14755	3.5	nothing   happens   in   this   movie   and   yet   it   is   still   entertaining .    good   on   them   for   making   it .
158121132	2922	4.0	one   of   my   favs   from   my   teen   years .
158121132	8327	4.5	ken   kesey   was   a   pioneering   genius   of   the   60s   psychadelic   movement .    this   is   a   brilliant   adaption   of   his   great   novel .
158121132	15233	4.0	really   funny   spoof   of   the   fashion   industry ,    i ['] ve   seen   it   a   few   times   now   and   it   gets   better   each   time .
158121132	6267	4.5	very   entertaining .    the   most   over - the - top   costumes   and   choreography ,    hilariously   bad   acting ,    and   one   of   the   most   phenomenal   film   soundtracks   ever .
158121132	10451	5.0	this   film   is   35   years   old   and   still   feels   fresh .    i   can   only   imagine   what   people      thought   of   it   at   the   time ,    pre - tarantino   and   other   routine   ultra - violence .    the   combination   of   the   consistent   visual   realisation   of   a   future   england ,    the   clothes ,    sets   and    ['] nadsad [']    slang   really   suck   you   in .    for   what   is   really   a   sci - fi   movie   it   hasn ['] t   really   dated   much   at   all .
158121132	3333	3.5	i   found   myself   getting   quite   involved   in   this .    nice   soundtrack .
158121132	3875	4.0	simple   but   entertaining   road - trip   movie   through   south   america .
158121132	6720	4.0	one   of   the   better   war   movies   of   recent   times .    i   love   the   shots   of   the   helicopters   flying   over   mogadishu !    not   as   one - sided   as   expected .
158121132	6450	4.0	shot   like   a   documentary ,    very   realistic   story   of   drugs   wars   in   a   brazilian   favela .    definitely   worth   seeing .
158121132	3962	4.0	the   amount   of   creativety   in   these   pixar   movies   puts   a   lot   of   non - animated   movies   to   shame .    ellen   degeneres   is   great   as   dory ,    the   fish   with   a . d . d .
158121132	7664	4.0	ridley   scott   rocks .    it ['] s   a   bit   odd   how   it ['] s   simultaneous   a   stand   against   violence   and   a   celebration   of   it   though .    really   enjoyable   epic - style   film .    the   actresses   in   this   film   are   gorgeous .
158121132	6029	3.0	nice   story ,    but   a   bit   too   cutesy   for   me .
158121132	16008	4.0	saw   this   recently   on   tv   and   it   was   still   great .
158121132	12355	2.0	not   completely   unwatchable   but   getting   that   way .    cliche   ridden   sci - fi   meets   sappy   fairy   tale ,    meets   a   john   williams   score   oozing   out   your   ears .    great   acting   from   jude   law   and   haley   osmet   can ['] t   resurrect   it .
158121132	5862	5.0	drink   a   coffee   before   watching   this   movie   because   you ['] re   going   to   need   to   be   wide   awake   to   understand   it .    half   the   scenes   in   this   movie   go   forwards   in   time   and   half   backwards .    an   amazing   twist   at   the   end   and   very   thought   provoking   commentary   on   the   nature   of   memory .    stylishly   shot   and   great   acting .    a   left - brained   companian   to   eternal   sunshine   and   the   spotless   mind .
158121132	3917	4.5	another   movie   that   is   great   at   capturing   a   particular   mood .    i   really   enjoyed   it .    it ['] s   funny   and   sad   at   the   same   time ,    and   really   captures   something   of   life   in   new   jersey .
158121132	6531	2.5	didn ['] t   really   work   for   me .
158121132	14550	3.5	decent   but   much   overrated   i   think .
158121132	12232	4.5	it   captures   a   certain   mood   more   than   it   tells   a   story .    it ['] s   about   feeling   adrift   in   a   completely   foreign   place   and   briefly   crossing   paths   with   someone   for   a   short   time .    an   unusual   and   beautiful   movie .
158121132	12690	3.0	visually   this   is   stunning ,    but   the   storyline   drags   on   a   bit .
158121132	12694	3.5	they   shot   this   on   the   street   i   used   to   live       -    so   i   was   interested   to   see   it   when   it   came   out .    i   thought   this   movie   was   really   underated .    nicole   kidman   and   sean   pean   are   both   great ,    there ['] s   a   lot   of   smart   dialogue   and   although   the   storyline   is   a   little   contrived ,    i   found   it   stylish ,    suspenseful   and   absorbing .
158121132	4355	2.5	a   couple   of   the   scenes   that   are   scripted   work   okay    ( eg .    jack    &    meg )  ,    but   most   of   the   rest   falls   flat .    skip   ahead   to   bill   murray    &    rza / gza .
158121132	1865	5.0	difficult   to   sum   up .    one   of   my   favourites .
158121132	16740	4.5	a   rambling ,    beautiful   and   surreal   movie .    tom   cruise ['] s   performance   as   the   tv   stud   is   pretty   memorable .    aimee   mann ['] s   soundtrack   is   great .
158121132	6690	4.0	a   great   follow   up   to   rushmore ,    this   one   is   really   imaginative   too .    not   a   big   fan   of   gwyneth   paltrow ,    but   i   liked   her   character   in   this .
158121132	3864	4.0	great   dark   version   of   batman .
158121132	5515	5.0	although   this   is   about   the   russian   nuclear   threat ,    it   is   really   a   timeless   movie .    some   unforgettable   characters    -    and   peter   sellers   who   plays   more   than   one   of   them    ( often   in   the   same   scene !  )    is   amazing .
158121132	11301	4.0	unusual ,    funny   and   entertaining   cult    ['] horror [']    movie    ( although   it ['] s   not   at   all   scary )  .
226190144	2985	4.5	we ['] ve   got   a   bleeder !  !  !
226190144	14691	5.0	this   movie   changed   my   outlook   on   the   world .  . but   in   the   future ,    why   are   they   still   using   dial - up ?
226190144	11077	5.0	normally   i   can ['] t   stand   sequels ,    but   this   one   nails   every   angle .
226190144	2782	5.0	one   of   mel   gibson ['] s   best   performances ,    ever .

226190144	8989	5.0	mmm ,    julia   stiles .
226190144	3938	5.0	amazing   animation ,    humor ,    and   voice   talents   make   up   a   great   satirical   saga .    can ['] t   wait   for    # 3    :  -  )

226190144	7032	3.5	they ['] ll   never   top   the   first   austin   powers ,    but   it   still   has   its   good   points .
226190144	5239	4.0	not   nearly   as   good   as   the   original ,    but   sandler   makes   any   movie   worth   seeing .
226190144	3860	5.0	haha ,    do   i   even   have   to   say   anything ?
226190144	758	4.5	i   thought   i   would   hate   this   movie .  .  . but   somehow   seeing    *  *  *  *  *  *    getting   what   they   deserve ,    made   it   all   worthwhile .
226190144	12471	5.0	love   him   or   hate   him ,    he   still   rocked   the   box   office   and   music   charts .

302225161	3579	5.0	2   words    ( paul   walker )    and   you   know   why   i   said   that   lol
667420065	14691	4.0	very   good ,    a   bit   too   much   cgi .
667420065	15107	4.0	pretty   cool .    quite   good   managment   of   unreal   situations .
667420065	5762	4.0	good ,    quite   good .    could   have   been   better ,    though .
667420065	6196	5.0	simply   great !  !  !  !    watch   it
667420065	1905	3.5	the   overuse   of   cgi   spoils   everything .    the   rest   is   pretty   much   alright .
667420065	3938	3.0	cool   in   production ,    content   and   acting / character   acting .    some   unnecesary   funny   scenes   devalue   this   great   picture
667420065	7521	4.0	this   one   is   really   one   of   a   genre .    not   the   most   excellent   in   the   world   but   did   mark   a   moment   in   history   of   funny   movies   in   regard   to   scary   movies
667420065	8327	5.0	what   can   i   say ?    jack   is   the   man .
667420065	10451	5.0	no   words   could   explain .    you   have   to   see   it
667420065	17479	3.5	very   good .    a   bit   more   acting   and   editing ,    plus   explanation   of   lack   of   it   for   a   real   reason   is   needed   here .    the   japanese   version   is   not   that   great   in   comparisson   with   this   version ,    but   is   a   bit   more   down   to   earth   in   some   aspects .
667420065	13610	3.5	excellent   in   content   and   very   good   in   acting .    unreal   situations   and   too   much   use   of   cgi ,    lower   the   quality   of   this   movie
667420065	940	4.5	by   watching   a   semi - god ,    all   the   time   it   makes   you   feel   more   like   a   man .
667420065	3962	3.5	excellent   cgi   work   here .    good   content .    not    " the   movie "  ,    though
667420065	7664	3.0	fine .    excellent   production ,    very   good   russell .    even   better   richard   and      mr .    oliver    ( reast   in   peace )    quite   cool   and   emotive   but   not   classic .
667420065	17324	2.5	cool   if   a   man   like   him   could   do   what   he   does .    somewhat   nice   though .
667420065	16640	4.5	very   interesting   and   different   to   the   movies   that   are   made   now   a   days .
667420065	11337	3.5	really   funny   and   quite   interesting .    a   bit   more   acting   and   content   would   make   it   even   nicer .
667420065	5239	2.0	didn ['] t   enjoy   this   one .    i   excpected   more
667420065	9298	3.0	cool   and   entertaining
667420065	12471	3.0	quite   alright
667420065	1962	2.5	just   funny   to   spend   a   while
667420065	9120	5.0	excellent   movie .    one   of   my   favorites .    it   has   everything .    it   shows   you   everything .
667420065	9381	4.5	simply   life .    beautifully   done .    great   scarlet   and   superb   bill
667420065	11077	1.5	not   really   that   cool ,    you   know .
667420065	15205	2.5	to   spend   a   while   only .
667420065	16879	3.0	somewhat   cool   in   yerms   of   special   effects ,    editing   and   production .    personally   i   think   that   dicaprio   has   got   more   to   give   playing   a   different   role ,    such   as    " catch   me   if   you   can "    or    " the   man   in   the   iron   mask "  .    great   for   mr   cameron   and   aldo   for   the   good   old   billy   zane   as   well   as   kate   winslet
667420065	3860	3.0	very   good ,    enjoyable .    not   a   classic   though
667420065	11710	4.5	very ,    very   good
667420065	483	3.0	·    stars   for   movie   overall ,    but   if   you   wanna   have   a   good   time ,    then   do   watch   it .

154436341	7499	1.0	i   can ['] t   even   tell   you   how   bad   this   film   is .    however ,    it   had   the   most   incredible   ad   campaign   and   marketing .  .  . probably   in   history .
154436341	2782	4.0	maybe   only   slightly   historically   accurate ,    but   come   on !     " i   love   ya ,    always   have "  .    that ['] s   some   good   craic .

378126888	3463	3.5	ok .  .  . jag   gillar   töntiga   tonårsfilmer .  .  . jag   tycker   att   den   här   är   en   av   de   bättre .
378126888	15107	3.0	den   är   rätt   cool .
378126888	8989	2.0	okej ,    inte   mer .
378126888	1905	2.5	visst ,    rolig   för   att   vara   en   film   om   pirater ,    men   de   skulle   ju   ha   kunnat   förkorta   den   med   nån   timme .
378126888	7521	1.0	dålig   humor .
378126888	3320	3.0	mysig
378126888	17479	4.0	bra   för   att   vara   skräck !    känns   kuslig   och   ganska   verklig    ( inte   när   den   mystiska   tjejen   går   ut   ur   tv : n ,    men   annars )
378126888	13610	2.0	inte   min   sorts   film   direkt .  .  .
378126888	3962	4.0	sorglig ,    rolig ,    mysig .  .  .    en   bra   blandning .  .  .
378126888	2457	2.0	minns   inte   riktigt ,    men   jag   kan   inte   tänka   mig   att   jag   tyckte   att   den   var   bra .  .  .
378126888	17324	3.5	rätt   bra   film   faktiskt ,    i   alla   fall   bättre   än   jag   trodde .
378126888	2463	2.5	var   inte   så   bra   som   jag   trodde .  .  .
378126888	16879	2.5	är   lite   väl   lång ,    man   orkar   inte   se   den   igen .  .  .
378126888	11337	3.0	oerhört   dålig   humor ,    men   av   nån   anledning   får   jag   ändå   för   mig   att   jag   vill   kolla   på   den   ibland .  .  .    vet   inte   varför .
378126888	7032	1.5	ok .  .  .    han   har   fula   kläder ,    det   e   det   enda   roliga   typ .  .  .

62933911	10583	3.0	cute
62933911	2457	3.0	cute   but   that   would   never   happen .  .  . shes   too   skinny   she   is   too   pretty   to   not   get   noticed   in   high   school   and   be   made   popular .  .  . prettier   than   the   girl   who   played   shelby
62933911	17324	4.0	really   cute   again   looved   the   irony ,    kinda   stupid   how   she   didnt   follow   up   her   story   tho   most   people   would .  .  . not   true   fact

176246039	11242	4.0	a   very   strange   movie   that   turned   out   to   be   something   special ,    with   good   acting   and   nothing   being   predictable ,    it   quickly   became   a   hit   in   my   eyes .    some   hilarious   dialogue   here   and   superb   performances ,    particularly   from   jonothan   pryce .
176246039	3824	1.0	what   a   pile   of   absolute   shit .       the   only   reason   i   even   gave   this   one   star   is   because   at   times   the   diversity   was   funny .    it   was   mumbling   and   annoying   the   entire   way   through   it   and   i   want   my   2   hours   back .       now .
176246039	16390	4.0	not   quite   what   i   was   expecting ,    but   it   surpassed   that   so   no   need   to   worry .    power - house   performances   from   jodie   foster   and   jared   leto    ( who   shouldn ['] t   have   been   killed   off )    he   could ['] ve   really   turned   into   something   nuts   if   he   was   in   it   for   a   bit   longer .    all   around   a   good   movie   with   an   original   story .
176246039	3524	4.5	royale   wi [']    cheese !    this   is   tarantinos   best   work   very ,    very   easily   and   he ['] s   never   going   to   top   it .    nothing   else   of   his   even   comes   remotely   close   and   the   140   minutes   whizzes   by .    a   masterpiece   at   the   very   least .
176246039	14590	4.5	absolutely   fantastic ,    concrete   performances   from   bruce   willis   and   samuel   l .    jackson   here .    i   think   there   could ['] ve   been   vast   improvements   on   alot   of   the   villains   here   as   they   seemed   little   more   than   robots   in   every   way   possible .       superb   action   sequences   and   the   movie   is   certainly   not   a   disappointment .    kept   me   glued   to   the   chair   from   the   beginning   until   the   very   end .
176246039	5496	4.5	i   find   will   smith   is   a   hugely   under - rated   actor ,    he   fits   this   role   perfectly .    this   is   one   of   the   most   amazing   looking ;    if   not   the   most   amazing   looking   visual   effects   i ['] ve   ever   seen   in   a   movie .    sure   i ['] ve   seen   everything ,    but   when   it   comes   to   artificial   intelligence   it ['] s   just   that   much   more   interesting   than   everything   else .    the   plot   is   fantastic   and   each   character   is   pulled   off   fantastically ,    the   realness   of   the   robots   in   this   movie   is   astounding   which   is   why   it ['] s   in   my   favourites   list .    simply   and   utterly   fantastic .
176246039	3282	0.5	shite .
176246039	11283	4.5	another   one   i   had   to   rewatch   and   i ['] m   glad   i   did .    this   film   is   brimming   with   superb   acting   coming   from   an   amazing   cast ;    the   story   is   touching   and   uplifting   at   stages   too .    this   is   a   must   see   for   everyone .
176246039	2743	5.0	this   has   to   be   one   of   the   most   powerful   movies   in   existence ,    a   complete   masterpiece   which   is   by   far   the   best   portrayal   of   life   in   warsaw   between   1939   and   1945 .    adrian   brody   here   is   absolutely   astounding   and   more   than   deserved   the   oscar   he   won   for   his   performance ,    the   dedication   is   mindblowing .    it   had   me   mesmerised   from   start   to   finish ;    that   even   includes   the   complete   genius   going   on   throughout   the   credits .    do   yourself   a   favour   and   watch   this ,    quickly .
176246039	10451	2.5	it   was   alright ,    at   points   it   was   a   little   too   disturbing   though .
176246039	673	4.5	the   first   time   i   watched   this   i   didn ['] t   pay   much   attention   but   i ['] m   glad   i   watched   it   again .    when   i   paid   more   attention   the   plot   twists   and   turns   and   keeps   you   on   the   edge   of   your   seat   for   the   whole   2   hours   and   10   minutes .    spectacular   finale   and   superb   performances   from   edward   norton   and   brad   pitt .
176246039	10030	4.0	delightful .
176246039	12092	2.0	this   movie   made   me   hate   joel   schumacher ,    i ['] m   not   the   biggest   fan   of   george   clooney   either ,    robin   is   annoying   in   it ,    the   villains   are   rubbish    ( i   like   arnie   but   freeze   was   annoying )  .    bat   girl   is   a   joke ,    the   new   gadgets   are   a   joke ,    the   batmobile   is   a   joke .    this   movie   is   a   mockery   to   the   batman   franchise   and   i ['] m   glad   it ['] s   now   mildly   forgotten   thanks   to   christopher   nolan .
176246039	2186	4.5	very   anjoyable   action   flick .    superb   performances   from   both   will   smith   and   martin   lawrence   in   such   an   oddly   shaped   partnership   you   can ['] t   help   but   laugh .    laced   with   intense   shoot - ups ,    hilarious   one   liners    &    fantastic   direction .    this   is   one   for   the   dvd   collection .
176246039	17324	4.0	i   was   surprised   when   i   watched   this   as   previously   i   wasn ['] t   really   interested   in   seeing   it ,    if   i   wasn ['] t   with   my   girlfriend   i   wouldn ['] t   have   gave   it   a   second   look .    it ['] s   a   good   movie   to   watch   in   on   a   saturday   night   with   the   lady ,    it ['] s   actually   pretty   funny .    don ['] t   be   expecting   a   masterpiece   but   it   lifts   the   mood ,    the   plots   not   the   best   on   the   planet   but   it   seems    " fairly "    original   and   it   was   alright .
176246039	17622	3.5	i   found   this   very   strange   and   alot   of   parts   that   seemed   not   as   important   to   the   story   were   dragged   out   far   too   much .    i   also   think   that   they   tried   to   twist   the   plot   too   many   times   in   an   attempt   to   alienate   whoever   was   watching .    it   was   ok   and   performances   were   reasonable   from   cruise   and   kurt   russell   in   particular .
176246039	11812	4.5	wow .    clint   eastwoods   best   direction   i ['] ve   witnessed   yet ,    the   only   reason   i ['] m   not   giving   it   5   stars   is   i   would   like   to   have   seen   that   dirty   fleabag   who   broke   maggies   neck   get   slapped   around   a   bit   more .    apart   from   that   it   was   a   very   sad   ending   and   i   would   have   liked   it   if   maggie   was   on   the   road   to   recovery   kind   of   but   it   just   puts   you   on   a   downer ,    superb   stuff   though .

176246039	13052	4.5	ok   i ['] ll   start   by   saying   that   most   of   these   reviews   are   a   joke   on   this   movie .    stop   raving   on   about   johnny   depp   just   because   of   how   he   looks   ffs .  .    performance   wise ,    he   is   fantastic   here .    a   young   leonardo   di   caprio   absolutely   wiped   the   floor   with   everyone   in   this   movie   with   his   performance .  .    absolutely   amazing   portrayal .       alot   of   sadness   here ,    but   alot   of   very   lifting   and   moving   points   aswell .    it   struck   the   balance   almost   perfectly   and   it ['] s   a   nice   movie ,    i   really   enjoyed   it .

176246039	17762	3.5	i   enjoyed   this ,    it   was   very   mysterious .    although   hawke ['] s   performance   was   good ,    i   think   jude   law   would ['] ve   been   better   suited   in   the   lead   role .       it   was   enjoyable   all   the   same   though ,    i   loved   the   soundtrack   aswell .
176246039	16565	4.0	enjoyable   movie   with   another   great   performance   as   per   usual   from   kevin   spacey .    the   story   wasn ['] t   all   that   complicated   at   stages   but   still   a   good   movie   and   left   me   glad   i   purchased   it .
176246039	7828	3.0	not   the   thickest   or   best   story   on   the   planet ,    but   again   it ['] s   not   the   worst   i ['] ve   seen .    it   could ['] ve   been   alot   worse   and   here   we   slightly   see   an   evil   side   of   ryan   phillipe   which   made   me   realise   why   he   was   in   the   running   for   the   part   of   harvey   dent   in    " the   dark   knight "  .
176246039	17004	3.5	very   enjoyable ,    although   questionable   acting   throughout .    so   many   slasher   movies   since   this   movie   have   tried   to   achieve   the   same   effect   and   very   few   actually   do ;    regardless   of   how   much   money   is   spent   on   it .          here   michael   myers   is   played   by   a   small   actor   yet   the   character   is   fantastic .

176246039	7937	4.0	a   truly   original   story   which   surpassed   all   which   i   was   expecting   from   it .    great   performances   from   big   sean   connery   and   another   great   one   from   rob   brown .    a   great   movie   well   worth   the   watching ,    and   after   viewing   it   i   can   happily   say   i   will   purchase   it   when   possible .
176246039	3750	4.5	we   truly   see   a   different   side   to   tom   hanks   here ,    in   my   eyes   he   is   the   only   one   who   could   have   pulled   off   this   role   as   perfectly   as   it   was   done .    a   fantastic   piece   of   work   which   i   am   a   proud   owner   of   at   home .
176246039	5538	4.0	i   really   enjoyed   this ,    a   genuine   good   laugh .    most   of   the   dialogue   was   hilarious   and   at   times   random .       the   only   thing   i   will   say   that ['] s   pointless   about   it   was   the   whole   spaceship   thing .  .  .     =  /    otherwise   it   was   great .
176246039	3626	4.0	it ['] s   pretty   good   stuff ,    it   got   very   powerful   at   stages   particularly   with   speeches   from   edward   norton .    the   supporting   cast   of   psh   and   barry   pepper   were   fantastic .    it ['] s   really   hard   to   find   alot   to   say   about   it ,    but   it ['] s   good   you   should   watch   it .
176246039	13433	3.0	quite   funny ,    nothing   special   though   and   not   much   to   say   about   it .
176246039	1180	5.0	this   movie   was   a   very   big   surprise   to   me   as   i   didn ['] t   think   russel   crowe   could   pull   off   being   anything   but   mindless   muscle ;    this   movie   proved   me   wrong   on   quite   a   few   levels .          the   application   of   logic   to   reason   has   always   been   an   interesting   topic   to   me   which   had   me   glued   from   this   movie   from   the   word   go .          some   fantastic   performances   but   i   didn ['] t   think   ed   harris   was   as   good   in   this   one   as   he   usually   is .    alot   of   really   shocking   twists   and   as   the   movie   drew   to   a   close   it   makes   you   happier   and   happier   that   you   witnessed   it   and   it   fully   deserves   the   rating   i   gave   it .       i   re - assessed   my   thoughts   on   this   but   for   the   good ,    it   truly   is   worth   the   full   5   stars .

176246039	2122	4.0	this   is   an   extremely   strange   idea   which   was   surprisingly   pulled   off   really   well .    most   of   the   performances   were   fantastic   with   the   exception   of   cameron   diaz ;    her   performance   just   continually   annoyed   me   until   the   movie   was   finished .       it   was   really   strange   to   watch   but   alot   of   wonderfully   unique   ideas   here   and   it ['] s   just   simply   brilliant   to   watch   them   all   come   together .       also ,    charlie   sheen   was   a   nice   addition   to   the   cast   here ;    the   scenes   with   him   in   it   had   me   in   knots .
176246039	2776	4.5	mind - blowing   stuff ,    it   really   is .    bruce   willis   is   fantastic   in   this   role   and   it ['] s   most   definetly   one   of   his   best .    samuel   l .    jackson   shocks   as    " mr .    glass "    and   is   also   the   first   character   in   a   movie   for   a   very   long   time   that   has   genuinely   sent   a   frightening   chill   up   my   spine .    great   direction   and   just   all   round   a   great   movie .
176246039	14203	3.5	the   second   worst   out   of   the    " modern "    batman   movies   but   despite   the   director   trying   to   turn   gotham   city   into   a   big   orgy   rave ,    there   was   some   pretty   solid   performances   from   val      kilmer    /    jim   carrey    &    tommy   lee   jones .
176246039	8379	4.5	very   good   stuff ,    always   good   to   see   a   great   portrayal   of   the   misery   occured   during   such   events .    the   only   thing   that   annoyed   me   in   this   movie   was   the   english   accents   creeping   through   when   they ['] re   supposed   to   be   russian ,    but   other   than   that   it ['] s   a   great   story   from   the   point   of   view   of   the   infamous   sniper   vassily   zaitzev .    some   great   performances ;    particularely   from   ed   harris   and   jude   law .
176246039	1324	4.0	i   quite   enjoyed   this ,    great   acting   from   reno ,    oldman   and   portman   and   a   very   subtle   story .    the   shooting   scenes   were   great   throughout   the   movie   and   the   end   one   certainly   delivered .       i   feel   that   gary   oldman   just   may   have   stole   the   show   here   as   he   plays   the   fantastic   villain .
176246039	1798	5.0	an   absolute   classic   from   start   to   finish ,    it ['] d   been   years   since   i ['] d   seen   this   and   i ['] m   glad   i   bought   the    " lethal   weapon   collection "    boxset   recently   because   it   really   is   top   of   the   line   entertainment .       this   movie   started   the   trend   of   buddy   cop   movies   and   there ['] s   not   a   cop   movie   that   comes   close   to   being   as   entertaining .    i   enjoy   most   of   them   in   their   own   ways   but   this   is   head   and   shoulders   above   the   rest   of   them ;    especially   with   that   mel   gibson   mullet !
176246039	4551	4.5	this   is   sheerly   brilliant   stuff ,    i   was   in   knots   most   of   the   way   through   it   even   though   the   storyline   didn ['] t   hint   at   anything   but   being   deadly   serious .       it ['] s   really   not   as   good   as   lock ,    stock    &    2   smoking   barrels   but   it ['] s   another   way   above   average   attempt   from   guy   ritchie .
176246039	11152	5.0	what   can   i   honestly   say ,    i   underestimated   this   movie   far   too   much .    for   a   long   time   i   kept   saying   i   hated   the   message   and   so   on ,    without   truly   noticing   the   massive   turn   around   and   the   irony   it   caps   it   all   off   with .       from   a   half   star   rating   to   a   5   star   rating   is   quite   a   change   because   i   realised   how   complex   it   was   throughout   this   time   around ,    possibly   because   this   time   i ['] m   actually   old   enough   to   watch   the   movie   and   fully   understand   what   it ['] s   about .       this   is   a   movie   you   have   to   watch   with   an   open   mind   or   you   will   say   strange   things   about   it ,    believe   me   i   know .    edward   norton   has   rocketed   up   my   ranks   after   i   finally   got   the   chance   to   fully   appreciate   what   a   great   performance   this   was   and   what   a   great   actor   he   really   is .       this   is   a   bold   statement   to   close   off   what   i ['] m   trying   to   say   here ,    this   is   the   most   powerful   movie   i   have   ever   seen   in   my   life .    the   transformation   of   edward   norton   which   slowly   takes   place   throughout   the   movie   in   many   different   forms   is   powerful   enough   to   knock   you   off   your   seat .       again   i   am   glad   i   re - watched   this   and   appreciated   the   turn   around   as   i   really   didn ['] t   know   what   i   was   missing .    fucking   fantastic .
176246039	15425	3.0	i   was   expecting   a   little   more   from   this ,    i   paid   alot   of   attention   to   the   dialogue   and   the   best   of   it   came   from   john   goodman   and   not   jeff   bridges   i ['] m   afraid   to   say .    it   was   funny   at   stages ,    it   has   a   certain   rewatch   factor   but   i ['] m   not   so   sure   i   will   watch   it   again .

410984709	8393	3.0	really   rather   disappointed   by   this   movie .  .  .  . backdraft   is   a   considerably   better   firefighter   movie
410984709	16516	3.0	this   is   an   incredibly   annoying   movie .    run   the   guy   over   and   keep   driving   stop   going   back   to   look !  !  !  !
410984709	15890	3.0	who   knew   a   toaster   could   be   a   star !
410984709	17479	3.0	really   didn ['] t   find   this   movie   scary
410984709	17321	5.0	it ['] s   disney .  .  . no   less   than   a   5   will   do !
410984709	11123	2.5	i ['] ve   only   seen   it   because   it   was   on   tv .  .  . the   blonde   kid   star   is   annoying   as   anything   but   the   movie   isn ['] t   completely   terrible .
410984709	3151	3.5	it   was   actually   better   the   second   time   around .
410984709	3962	5.0	nothing   better   than   disney !

410984709	15755	3.5	not   as   good   as   i   remember   it   being   the   first   time   i   saw   it .
410984709	9518	0.5	embarrassing   to   admit   but   yes ,    i   have   actually   seen   this !    it   was   beyond   terrible !
410984709	2689	3.0	if   only   i   had   actually   seen   the   ending !
410984709	3579	2.0	crappy   sequel   with   bad   acting .  .  . the   car   chase   is   awesome   though
410984709	896	5.0	watch   it   from   the   standpoint   of   one   human   being   trying   to   help   another   and   not   a   white   chick   trying   to   save   the   minorities   and   it   is   awesome !
410984709	15110	4.0	it ['] s   all   about   nemesis !
410984709	11040	5.0	football   and   an   incredibly   touching   plot .  .  .  . amazing !

410984709	14999	5.0	i   am   not   sure   i   could   stomach   watching   it   again   but   it   was   incredibly   acted   and   filmed !
410984709	15956	4.5	definitely   one   of   my   favourite   bruce   willis   movies !
410984709	6720	3.5	not   generally   my   kind   of   movie   but   incredible !
410984709	14507	5.0	besdies   the   fact   that   it   is   football ,    shower   scene   with   handsome   football   players .  .  . need   i   say   more ?  ?
410984709	334	3.5	not   as   good   as   arnie ['] s   kindergarten   cop   but   still   funny !
410984709	11607	3.5	i   was   bored .  .  . it   was   on   the   movie   channel .  .  . definitely   a   testament   to   the   strength   of   the   human   heart   in   the   face   of   the   unspeakable .
410984709	6029	3.0	i   don ['] t   understand   what   all   the   fuss   was   about   on   this   movie !
410984709	1046	3.5	surprisingly   cute .
410984709	2779	2.5	disappointing
410984709	2400	2.5	one   was   probably   enough   on   this   one !
410984709	4432	5.0	i ['] d   watch   it   just   for   the   mini   car   chase !
410984709	9442	4.0	admittedly   not   as   good   as   the   first   but   it ['] s   still   riddick !
410984709	3605	3.0	a   classic
410984709	12232	1.0	fell   asleep   trying   to   watch   this   too .  .  . i   really   don ['] t   get   all   the   hype   on   this   movie   either !
410984709	14909	3.5	a   little   bit   of   a   sleeper   movie   but   still   quite   good   if   you   are   in   the   mood   for   sentimental   stuff .
410984709	2528	3.0	good   movie   but   too   many   creepy   crawlers   for   me !
410984709	13651	4.0	i   just   happened   to   come   across   this   one   on   tv   and   loved   it !    i   was   screaming   at   the   tv   throughout   the   entire   movie .

410984709	6482	3.0	the   e - woks   were   cute !
410984709	3106	3.5	it   was   a   good   movie   but   not   nearly   as   good   as   it   was   touted   as   being .
410984709	1073	5.0	even   though   it   is   a   basketball   movie .  .  . incredible !
410984709	6886	3.5	raunchy   but   the   overall   movie   isn ['] t   bad .
410984709	7987	3.0	do   not   ask   me   why   i   have   seen   this !    i   hate   this   type   of   movie !

32814323	3638	5.0	these   two   are   perfect   for   eachother .    they   make   a   great   duo   in   this   movie   to   make   it   a   great   comedy .
32814323	14103	5.0	so   sad   i   cried   for   the   last   half   hour   the   first   time   i   watched   it .  .  . and   the   second   time .    yes   i   cried !  !

32814323	11771	1.0	i   thought   it   would   be   scary ,    but   turned   out   to   be   an   alien   soap   opera .  .  . boooo !  !  !

376411449	2554	5.0	really   super   weird    .  .  . has   a   transgender   person   in   it .  .  .  . but   still   the   awsomest   movie   ever

376411449	9645	4.0	pretty   good   but   kinda   little   kidish
831678331	2580	4.0	so   funny !    they   chose   the   two   best   actresses   for   the   roles ;    lindsay   lohan   was   such   a   great   actress   in   it   and   jamie   lee   curtis   was   hilarious !
831678331	686	3.0	it   was   good   but   i   think   the   ending   is   quite   terrible !    elizabeth   hurley   is   superb   as   the   devil ,    brendan   fraser   is   ok   but   i   don ['] t   particularly   like   him .
831678331	15844	4.5	this   is   just   a   brilliant   movie .    it   shows   all   the   different   sides   of   the   argument   and   it ['] s   great   when   they   finally   pull   together !
831678331	11443	4.0	kenneth   branagh   was   great   as   gilderoy   lockhart ;    so   funny !
831678331	16522	4.5	it ['] s   great !    i ['] m   not   sure   if   it ['] s   because   of   the   super   cast    ( richard   gere   and   susan   sarandon   are   a   match   made   in   heaven !  )    or   the   storyline   but   i   love   it !    this   does   not   mean   i   like   jennifer   lopez   in   any   way ,    they   could   have   picked   someone   else   for   her   role   in   my   eyes   but   i   will   watch   it   even   if   she ['] s   still   in   it   lol !
831678331	2412	4.5	my   favourite   in   the   series ,    they   didn ['] t   do   the   books   much   justice   but   it ['] s   still   good !

831678331	6287	3.0	it ['] s   ok   but   really   not   the   greatest !
831678331	16954	5.0	another   amazing   film   in   this   series !    great   to   see   sean   connery   as   henry   jones   snr .    he   and   harrison    [ ford ]    made   a   perfect   father / son   combination !  !    and   the   holy   grail .  .  . wow !

650525581	17508	5.0	this   is   probably   my   favorite   movie .       it   really   delves   into   the   concept   of   addiction ,    showing   how   anybody   can      become   addicted   to   anything .       the   mother   was   addicted   to   television ,    which   led   to   an   obsession   with   being   on   tv ,    which   led   to   an   addiction   to   drugs .    her   son   was   also   addicted   to   drugs ,    and   his   girlfriend   was   addicted   to   sex ,    as   result   of   her   addiction   to   drugs .  . and   on   and   on   and   on .       the   acting   was   on   point .       and   the   film   editing   was   exceptionally   dope !          overall ,    i   fux   wit   it   heavy .  .

650525581	13707	5.0	there   was   a   time   when   i   would   come   home   from   school   and   watch   this   movie   daily .       i   memorized   every   line   in   the   movie   and   one   time   i   had   a   dream   that   i   was   tony   montana ,    living   the   miami   high   life .  .    but   what   goes   up ,    must   come   down .       and   just   like   my   dream   soon   deflated   and   i   fell   back   down   to   earth ,    realizing   that   i   wasnt   a   miami   kingpin ;    scarface ,    who   excelled   as   an   underworld   giant ,    also   came   down   to   earth   as   he   fell   to   his   inevitble   demise .       he   had   it   all :    the   money ,    the   woman ,    and   the   power .       but   he   let   his   jealously   and   mistrust   destroy   his   empire .       he   started   getting   high   on   his   own   supply   and   simply   lost   focus .       but   this   film   keeps   you   entertained   as   it   shows   how   the   world ,    which   was   once   his ,    quickly   began   to   collapse   around   him .

785778876	13894	2.5	i   found   this   movie   to   be   boring .    a   man   sitting   on   an   island   by   himself   for   90   mins   talking   to   a   volleyball   is   not   my   idea   of   a   good   time .

785778876	7635	3.0	there   are   some   good   lines   in   this   movie .       the   whole   pants - party   part   is   truly   one   of   my   favourites .

792008828	15205	4.5	i   think   the   best   part   about   this   movie   was   how   believeable   it   was .    you   could   actually   see   it   happening .
792008828	3938	4.0	better   then   the   first   because   it   didn ['] t   have   smash   mouth .
792008828	10928	3.0	this   movie   was   funny ,    but   parts   of   it   were   just   too   dumb   for   me .
792008828	7521	4.0	the   first   one   was   origonal   and   funny ,    then   they   kind   of   went   down   hill   from   there .

246222464	10583	5.0	jack   black   makes   the   whole   thing   funny   and   just   makes   the   whole   thing   seem   like   it   could   really   happen .    maybe .    sorta .    kinda .

246222464	758	4.0	very   true ,    and   that ['] s   what   makes   it   so   good .    i   could   picture   that   happening   to   someone   that   i   know .

840198523	3938	3.5	very   good   but   the   first   one   still   had   the   benifit   of   being   the   first   to   introduce   us   to   shrek   and   his   world .

591377321	7521	3.0	typical   slapstick   comedy ,    i   like !
591377321	10928	1.5	one   of   the   first   films   i   went   to   see   without   adults !       really   didn ['] t   find   it   funny   but   one   of   my   friends   loved   it

189402067	14691	4.0	a   classic ,    one   of   the   few   performances   where   keanu   reeves   was   actually   good .    however ,    lawrence   fishburne   really   made   the   movie .
189402067	3254	0.5	this   movie   was   totally   lame .    the   comic   book   was   way   better .

189402067	10583	4.0	great   movie ,    jack   black   was   brilliant .
189402067	5571	3.0	i   know   its   a   classic ,    but   sly   stallone   is   a   really   crappy   actor ,    even   in   rocky .
189402067	7664	5.0	a   true   classic .    brillant   fighting ,    good   plot ,    great   action .    maximus   was   played   really   well .

189402067	5991	5.0	artistic ,    as   well   as   brutal .  .  .    totally   underrated .    this   movie   was   sheerly   awesome .  .  .    infact   it   was   more   awesome   than   chuck   norris .  .  .    if   thats   possible .
189402067	3579	0.5	really   really   pathetic ,    no   plot ,    lame   rice   mobiles .    this   movie   licks   my   sweaty   balls   something   fierce .
189402067	1962	0.5	chick   flick .  .    sandler   sucks   like   most   of   his   new   movies .
7941657	16390	4.5	quite   astonishing   how   this   film   came   out   to   be . i   was   on   the   edge   of   my   seat   from   start   to   finish .       some   of   my   favourite   actors   in   the   film ,    they   didn ['] t   fail   to   perform   immensely   well . the   suspense   when   she   tries   to   get   her   mobile   is   brilliant ,    you   just   wanna   shout   at   the   screen   and   hope   she   gets   back   in   that   room   in   time .  .  . the   slow - mo   just   makes   the   feeling   greater .  . brilliant .
7941657	3287	3.0	a   bit   dull .  .  .  . too .  .  .  . over   done
7941657	5020	2.5	not   too   funny ,    and   not   too   bad .  .  . it   was   ok .
7941657	14691	4.0	a   good   film   with   some   well   rememberable   senes .
7941657	2985	3.0	it   was   alright   i   guess    :  )       love   that   hair   joke   lol
7941657	15063	4.0	a   film   that   i   watched   only   once   which   was   enough .       anymore   and   the   film   just   isnt   funny   anymore
7941657	17479	3.0	it   was   ok ,    the   japanese   versions   are   better   though
7941657	13610	4.0	its   a   good   movie ,    i   enjoyed   it .
7941657	2186	3.5	very   very   good .
7941657	7664	4.5	i   must   say ,    i   began   to   watch   the   first   5   mins   of   this   back   when   i   was   13 .  .  .    i   found   it   boring   and   switched   it   off .       how   stupid   i   was   back   then !       the   story   and   plot   is   supurb .  .  . its   hard   to   fault   it .       its   not   drastically   predictable   either ,    its   even   well   written .       as   for   the   acting ,    well   i   think   that   just   tops   it   off . i   cant   fault   not   a   single   actor / ress   in   this   movie ,    something   i   havent   been   able   to   do   for   a   long   time .       the   visual   effects   put   me   back ,    infact   the   more   the   movie   went   on ,    the   more   i   was   lost   in   its   glory . not   many   films   have   had   that   effect   on   me ,    now   that   ive   finally   got   round   to   seeing   it ,    i   just   regret   putting   this   aside   when   younger . i   recommend   this   alot ,    ridley   scott ,    a   legend .
7941657	3414	3.0	cartoon ?    so   what ,    i   can   enjoy   it   too   cant   i ?       i   actually   thought   this   was   pretty   good .    not   disneys   best ,    but   not   the   worst   either .
7941657	28	3.0	not   a   bad   animation
7941657	4995	1.5	perfect   acting   skills .  .  .  .  . lol .
7941657	14712	2.5	this   was   the   first   film   i   bought   on   dvd .       ahh   the   olden   times .       it   gets   an   extra   half   a   star   for   that   fact ,    but   other   than   that .  .  . it   wasnt   a   tomb   raider   style   that   the   games   were   like ,    a   fine   effort   of   course ,    but   was   it   really   that   good ?       not   for   me .
7941657	3138	4.0	it   wasnt   as   good   as   the   1st .  .  . or   the   2nd   even .  .  . but   well .  .  . its   blade ,    it   cant   be   that   bad    : p
7941657	7381	3.0	it   was   ok ,    i   found   it   rather   boring .
7941657	305	2.0	its   a   bit .  .  .  .  .  " ummm "  .  .  .  . in   the   terms   of   an   opinion .  .  . it   was   good   and   bad .  .  . lol .
7941657	1406	3.5	i   remember   this   one ,    very   good   version .
7941657	5054	3.5	probably   the   best   of   them   all
7941657	6844	2.0	im   not   a   big   car   fan .  .  . i   love   watching   top   gear   however ,    i   enjoy   watching   that ,    i   didnt   enjoy   this   at   all .
7941657	12355	3.0	a   touching   film   yet   can   drag   on   a   little .
7941657	11077	4.0	great   original   commedy ,    thoroughly   enjoyed   watching   this .
7941657	4914	3.0	watch   your   films   through   your   standard   tv   speakers ? dont   bother   with   this . watch   your   films   through   high   quality   surround   sound ? you   might   get   the   intended   effect   with   this   film . notice   however ,    i   said ,     " might .  "       to   me   this   is   a   fresh   idea   to   the   thriller   genre ,    but   i   felt   it   went   to   waste   with   this   movie .       even   if   you   do   have   this   surround   sound   set   up   to   loud ,    bar   a   few   slight   moments ,    this   is   actually   rather   boring .       it   never   feels   like   it   picks   up ,    and   the   parts   to    " scare "    you   felt   cheap   and   wasteful .       this   had   opportunity   slapped   all   over   it ,    but   they   never   took   it .       at   a   quick   glance   at   the   story ,    it   seems   rather   good ,    but   just   not   that   good .
7941657	17308	1.5	if   reese   wanted   to   finish   her   career   as   soon   as   possible   then   this   really   is   the   way   to   go   about   it .
7941657	15205	2.0	i   didnt   really   like   this   so   much .
7941657	798	2.5	i   think   its   pretty   crap   personally
7941657	4109	3.5	weird   but   in   a   good   way .  .  . which   is   also   weird .  .  .  .
7941657	9635	3.5	an   old   favourite   of   mine .
7941657	1625	5.0	my   all   time   fav
7941657	1865	4.0	i   was   shocked   at   how   this   film   turned   out   to   be ,    pleasently   shocked   may   i   add . i   really   dont   know   what   i   can   say   about   it ,    it   was   certainly   different   and   maybe   thats   why   i   liked   it   so   much .
7941657	13050	2.5	its   a   reasonable   film ,    nothing   to   remember   from   it   really .       they   work   good   together   and   some   parts   gave   me   a   good   old   smile .       so   if   your   after   a   quiet   fell   good   film   with   nothing   to   thrill   you   with   then   this   is   right   up   there . to   be   honest   though ,    if   it   wasnt   for   hugh   grant   and   sandra   bullock ,    then   this   film   will   be   absolutely   nothing .       so   maybe   that   might   clarify   why   its   got   the   score   it   did   from   me .
7941657	15764	0.5	this   was   a   joke   right ? you   possibly   cant   take   this   film   seriously ,    was   it   actually   about   anything ?    lol
7941657	5571	3.5	a   great   classic ,    i   love   watching   this   from   time   to   time .
7941657	17293	3.0	wasnt   as   good   as   the   first   one .
7941657	7511	4.5	the   fight   scenes   are   a   little   under - par   to   today ['] s   standards ,    but   they   still   are   great   to   watch .       the   script   and   story   line   is   well   crafted   and   snipes   puts   in   a   stellar   performance .       i   cant   really   think   of   any   negative   things   i   can   say   about   this .  .  .  .  " campy   acting "  ?  ?  ?    get   a   grip .
7941657	299	2.5	it   bored   me ,    to   be   brutally   honest .  .  . i   don ['] t   see   what   the   fuss   was   all   about .
7941657	4123	4.0	i   actually   watched   this   a   few   years   back   and   i   cried ,    it   was   a   brilliant   film .  .  . maybe   i   need   to   watch   it   again   to   make   a   valid   rating ,    but   my   rating   will   be   from   back   then .
7941657	9645	2.5	my   mother   seems   to   love   this   film ,    i   mean   loves   this   film .    i   cant   see   why ,    it   wasnt   very   ammusing   for   me ,    and   it   just   got   that   little   bit   boring   towards   the   end .  .  . i   was   checking   the   time   h   alfway   through   watching   cause   it   felt   like   it   was   dragging .    nevr   the   less ,    although   its   not   eddie ['] s   best   movie   ever ,    ive   seen   much   worse   movies   so   i ['] ll   give   it   credit   for   that    : p
7941657	3579	1.0	i   dont   really   like   all   this .  .  .
7941657	7227	3.0	it   was   ok   actually .
7941657	2372	3.5	an   impressive   second   encounter .       it   never   feels   like   its   dragging   on   as   theres   always   something   going   on   or   going   to   go   on ,    you   forget   the   time .       its   a   well   thought   our   film ,    many   things   that   had   feeling   satisfied   with   how   some   sequences   panned   out .       it   wasnt   predictable ,    and   there   are   some   nice   twists   and   turns .       overall   a   decent   film   to   watch   with   family / mates .
7941657	13417	2.5	it   was    " ok "  .  .  .
7941657	468	4.5	for   some   reason ,    i   really   enjoyed   this .       watched   it   on   sky   movies   and   well ,    for   me   its   the   best   out   of   this   or   the   1st   one .       i   havent   seen    " reloaded "    but   for   me   to   like   this   when   i   aint   even   seen   that   says   something .       the   scale   of   it   sometimes   is   massive ,    although   at   points   its   gets   over   the   top   and   is   almost   laughable ,    but   hey .  .  . thats   what   made   the   film .       so   considering   that ,    it   achieved   what   it   aimed   to   achieve ,    and   its   got   my   vote .
7941657	15953	3.0	i   used   to   watch   this   all   the   time ,    i   still   remember   alot   of   it   which   is   scary   considering   the   last   time   i   saw   it   was   probably   10   years   ago .  .  .
7941657	1983	4.0	i   was   shocked   that   i   ended   up   really   liking   this   film .  .  .  . it   was   very   good .
7941657	2136	2.5	wasn ['] t   that   great ,    its   too   much   like   the   other   teen   comedies .  .  .  . i   don ['] t   find   in   your   face   comedy   funny   at   all
7941657	6042	2.0	i   found   this   quite   disappointing
7941657	8086	1.5	was   this   a   joke ?
7941657	15471	4.5	utterly   amazing   film   that   doesn ['] t   try   to   push   boundaries ,    it   just   kept   me   hooked ,    that ['] s   all   i   can   say .
7941657	17149	3.0	it   made   me   jump   a   few   times ,    thats   basically   down   to   me   having   my   surround   system   up   full   whack   just   to   get   some   kind   of   scary   effect   lol .  .  . an   overal   ok   film ,    a   bit   over   the   top   with   the    " scary "    sound   build   ups   though .  .  .
7941657	10921	3.5	i   was   expecting   this   to   be   a   cheesy   little   teen   flick   with   no   direction   what   so   ever .       this   wasnt   the   case ,    i   found   many   parts   rather   funny   and   it   was   a   good   performance   by   both   ashton   and   brittany .       a   nice   film .
7941657	16469	3.0	i   hate   this   film ,    has   ruined   the   name    " alien "    totally .       all   alien   films   should   be   an   18 ,    or   theres   just   no   point   in   making   them .  .  . making   this   was   just   for   money ,    that   was   obvious .       becides   aliens   just   isnt   right   without   sigourney   weaver
7941657	11337	3.0	although   predictable   it   was   a   little   bit   funny
7941657	14858	2.0	wasnt   all   that   much   to   me .
7941657	12471	2.0	it   was   a   big   attempt   at   making   a    " hit   film "    for   eminem ,    it   was   no   where   near   being   one .
7941657	10429	4.5	ahh   the   second   one .       its   a   very   good   sequel .       the   start   is   tremendous   i   must   say ,    from   watching   it   at   first   you   got   the   idea   that   there   may   be   a   crash ,    but   to   the   way   they   showed   it   was   another   thing   altogether .       anyways ,    very   good .
7941657	8636	2.0	its   a   film   i   would   say    " meh "    to   and   shrug   after   watching   it .  .  .  . there   was   no   point   in   creating   it ,    oh   wait   there   was .  .  . profits .
7941657	5793	4.0	great   film ,    i   really   cant   think   of   anything   negative   about   this   what   so   ever .
7941657	3605	3.0	not   bad ,    classic ?  .  .  . maybe .
7941657	16882	2.5	was   this   supposed   to   be   funny   anyone ?  .  .  . if   it   was   then   maybe   i   have   a   corrupt   sense   of   humour .
7941657	5939	3.0	preferred   the   first   one   really ,    didnt   see   much   in   this   one .
7941657	9340	3.0	yh   its   ok .  .  . the   first   hour .  .  . dreadful , the   second   hour .  .  .  . debateable , the   final   hour .  .  .  .  . i   was   sleeping .
7941657	6350	4.0	they   clash   soo   much   that   it   just   works .       the   plot   is   very   similar   and   isnt   highly   original ,    but   it   does   things   its   own   way   and   improves   on   the   plot .       i   enjoyed   it .
7941657	16879	3.0	its   a   good   film ,    but   nothing   special   to   me
7941657	7032	4.0	this   is   funny   stuff
7941657	14312	5.0	in   a   way ,    for   when   it   was   created   it   was   a   breakthrough .       certainly   in   sfx   but   also   in   sound .       not   many   people   realise   that ,    but   this   is   the   film   that   started   my   love   for   steven ['] s   work .       there   are   few   flaws ,    but   one   sticks   to   mind .  .  . when   the   raptor   looks   up   at   the   vents .  .  . i   duno   what   goes   on   with   its   skin .  .  . maybe   its   just   me   though .
7941657	16377	2.5	its   good ,    and   i   can   see   why   it   is   credited   so   high .  .  . but   it   wasnt   much   for   me .       maybe   i   lost   the   will   to   live   when   watching   this   but   i   actually   got   a   little   bored . maybe   i   need   to   watch   it   again .  .  . maybe .  .  .
7941657	12115	2.0	had   this   on   a   crappy   huge   tape   recorded   from   tv   yonks   ago   lol ,    it   was   ok .
7941657	3860	4.0	not   jim   carreys   best   but   just   it   doesnt   mean   its   bad    ;  )
7941657	17703	3.0	it   wasnt   great ,    it   wasnt   too   bad .  .  .  . its   nothing   id   watch   twice   though .
7941657	483	3.0	hmm   i   cant   really   remember   this ,    but   i   know   ive   seen   it . it   just   tells   me   that   it   wasnt   much   cop   in   the   first   place .  .  . i ['] ll   give   it   3   stars   cause   of   that ,    maybe   i   need   to   watch   it   again   to   refresh   my   memory .

788453258	6428	3.5	briliant   film .    really   showed   the   prejadist   of   black   ppl   in   the   south
788777570	10774	3.0	i   didn ['] t   get   this   one    :  (
788777570	11242	3.5	i   had   originally   planned   only   to   see   about   5   minutes   of   the   movie   just   to   see   if   the   file   was   right ,    but   i   ended   up   watching   all   two - and - a - half   hours .    very   bizarre   surrealistic   film .    moving   in   places ,    with   great   sound   and   visuals    ( though   the   latter   were   a   kind   of   overkill )  .    i   sort   of   found   the   ending   a   little   awkward ,    but   on   the   whole ,    the   film   was   a   winner .    a   nice   satire   on   red   tape .    it   also   has   one   of   the   best   romantic   lines   in   cinema :     " care   for   a   little   necrophilia ?  " question :    why   does   everyone   associate   this   film   with   de   niro ?    he   was   hardly   there    : s
788777570	3524	4.5	very   classy   b )
788777570	2985	5.0	i   love   this   movie ,    though   it   spawned   a   very   regrettable   subgenre   of   comedies ,    none   of   which   were   are   funny   or   charming   as   this   one
788777570	14691	4.0	- ve   points   for   keanu   and   some   of   the   zen    (  ?  )    dialogue   that   did   not   really   seem   too   sincere .  .  .    kickass   film   all   the   same
788777570	7016	4.5	de   niro   in   one   of   the   best   acting   performances
788777570	468	0.5	absolute   bollocks
788777570	6206	4.0	the   best   parts   were   the   greek - identity   scenes
788777570	10451	4.0	i   had   avoided   this   film   for   a   long   time ,    because   the   idea   of   all   the   rape   scenes   disgusted   me .    but   the   film ['] s   message    ( against   forcing   a   person   into   being   a    " clockwork   orang "  )    was   deep   and   meaningful .    enough   so   to   let   me   appreciate   the   film ,    and   malcom   mcdowell ['] s   acting   too .    and   awesome   direction   by   kubrick .    having   said   that ,    it   was   at   times   a   bit   too   bombastic   for   my   taste .    i ['] d   love   to   read   the   book   now ,    though .
788777570	1865	4.5	wonderful ,    imaginative   film .    very   good   acting   by   jim   carey    (  !  )    and   the   rest   of   the   cast   too .    great   screen - writing   and   a   very   fresh   idea .    i ['] m   curious   to   see   kauffman ['] s   directorial   venture   synecdoche   now .    the   ending   left   a   little   to   be   desired   though .
788777570	10276	4.5	life   is   cruel   for   old - movie   buffs .    movies   like    " psycho "    have   been   destroyed   with   copycats   and   pop - culture   references .    i   can ['] t   really   appreciate   jean - luc   godard ['] s   as   easily   as   people   were   able   to ,    when   his   films   first   came   out .    and   i   can ['] t   truly   get   bowled   over   by   rashomon   as   i   would   have   if   i   was   an   old   critic   on   the   film   festival   circuit   in   the   fifties . nevertheless ,    rashomon   is   an   immensely   enjoyable   film ,    which   still   has   the   ability   to   draw   viewers   close   to   its   heart .
788777570	2360	4.5	great   singing ,    great   dancing ,    great   direction   and   great   acting .    i   wanna   learn   to   tapdance

788777570	3925	3.5	liked   this   one ,    and   the   fact   that   the   philosophy   took   precedence   over   the   action .  .  .    but   it   was   not   very   well   executed ,    imo

191174344	10928	4.0	one   word :    quality
191174344	6235	2.5	amazingly   cheezy
191174344	13610	1.0	a   sad   excuse   for   a   movie .    im   sure   the   only   reason   that   it   attracted   a   audience   was   because   it   showed   kyrsten   dunst   in   a   wet ,    see - through   shirt   in   a   suspiciousely   convenient   raining   scene .
191174344	10583	4.0	a   very   good   movie   and   yet   im   still   sure   those   children   could   never   play   music   that   good .
191174344	5571	4.0	an   excelllent   movie .    the   only   problem   with   the   rocky   series   is   that   all   the   movies   seem   to   retain   almost   the   exact   same   plot   and   story   line .
191174344	16879	1.0	this   movie   was   a   poor   excuse   for   a   sappy   movie   that   no   one   really   wanted   to   see .    and   yet   strangely   im   surprised   it   turned   out   as   well   as   it   did   because   really   how   good   of   a   movie   can   you   make   about   a   boat .    all   in   all   it   was   about   as   entertaining   as   watchin   grass   grow .
191174344	5239	5.0	this   is   just   one   of   those   movies   that   will   make   you   almost   piss   yourself   laughing .
191174344	3860	2.5	enjoyable   and   yet   not   enjoyable   to   justify   watching   it   again .
191174344	1962	4.0	quite   good .
191174344	3579	4.0	very   much   a   movie   that   tries   to   make   you   believe   that   the   director   has   some   idea   of   what   its   like   to   be   a   gangster / shady   kind   of   guy   and   yet   only   goes   further   along   the   road   to   proving   he   has   no   real   idea .    all   in   all   though   still   a   very   good   movie .

232322768	11077	4.0	very   cool   movie .    it   shouldn ['] t   be   seen   with   kids   under   10 ,    though

60809906	5705	3.5	best   of   the   new   ones
60809906	13273	2.0	pretty .    pretty   pointless   and   dull ,    that   is .    nice   choreography   of   martial   arts ,    a   few   nice   visual   moments .    dull   story ,    cardboard   characters .    if   all   you   want   is   beautiful   visuals ,    this   is   for   you .
60809906	11242	4.5	genius ,    maybe   more   so   now   than   when   it   was   made .    gilliam   has   the   most   wonderful   visual   imagination   of   any   live - action   director    ( because   he   is   also   an   animator ?  )    and   the   dark   retro - future   world   of   brazil      is   breathtakingly   realised .    plus   there ['] s   a   story ,    plus   there ['] s   characters   you   care   about ,    plus   it   doesnt   cop - out   at   the   end .    what   more   could   anybody   ask   for ?
60809906	14691	3.0	not   as   good   as   everybody   said .
60809906	5496	1.0	stupid   waste   of   time .    asimov ,    that   most   cool   and   intelligent   of   writers ,    must   be   turning   in   his   grave .    avoid   at   all   costs .
60809906	16139	1.5	steve   martin .    twat .    was   funny   for   about   two   minutes   sometime   in   the   mid   80 ['] s :    should   have   retired   back   then   and   saved   us   all   a   lot   of   pain .
60809906	1905	4.0	johnny   depp   is   just   fantastic .
60809906	11829	3.5	not   as   good   as    ['] the   nightmare   before   christmas [']  ,    but   some   good   images ,    especially   the   rotory   mouth   shark - fish
60809906	10168	3.5	one   day   hollywood   will   realise   that   making   a   film   of   a   comic   book   doesn ['] t   automatically   mean   that   you   have   to   suck   all   the   subtlty   and   character   out .    this   could   have   been   so   much   better .
60809906	11123	1.0	no   redeeming   features   whatsoever .    jonathan   frakes   has   the   opposite   of   a   midas   touch :    this   should   have   been   at   least   watchable .    in   fact   it ['] s   in   the   running   for   the   prize   for   worst   film   ever   made .    unbelievable .    somebody   paid   money   to   make   this .    update :    sophie   myles    ( lady   penelope )    is   brilliant   in   the   doctor   who   episode    ['] the   girl   in   the   fireplace [']  .    but   even   she   can ['] t   rescue   this .
60809906	13610	4.0	better   than   the   first   one .    best   super - hero   movie ,    but   that ['] s   not   saying   much !
60809906	940	2.0	marks   the   end   of   the   disney   renaissance .    from   here   on   pixar   are   the   masters .
60809906	17499	4.0	maybe   the   last   great   old - style   disney   movie .    formulaic   compared   with   the   better   modern   stuff .
60809906	12092	1.0	awful .    embarassing .    pointless .    avoid .
60809906	3962	3.0	ok ,    but   not   pixar ['] s   best    -    the   incredibles   is   better .
60809906	16272	4.0	all   very   impressive   visually ,    but   also   meaningful   and   touching   emotionally .    too   bad   that   the   success   of   this   meant   we   had   hero   and   house   of   flying   daggers   inflicted   on   us .
60809906	2463	5.0	possibly   the   best   american   animated   film   ever .    better   than   any   disney ,    better   than   any   james   bond .    up   there   with   the   simpsons
60809906	14210	4.0	this   could   be   the   saddest   film   ever .    a   fantastic   emotional   experience ,    but   just   a   teeny   weeny   bit   manipulative   maybe ?
60809906	4393	1.0	typical   gurning   jim   carrey   nonsense .    he   can   be   great    ( see   eternal   sunshine   on   the   spotless   mind )  ,    but   you ['] d   never   believe   it   from   this   drek .
60809906	5472	1.0	apart   from   the   original    ['] the   producers [']  ,    was   mel   brooks   ever   funny ?    you   wouldn ['] t   think   so   from   this   rubbish .
60809906	28	3.5	a   kind - hearted   movie   with   some   funny   bits ,    but   definitely   a   kid ['] s   animation .
60809906	11451	4.0	i   was   prepared   to   hate   this ,    because   it   takes   many   liberties   with   a   book   i   loved   as   a   kid .    but   actually   it   was   pretty   good   in   it ['] s   own   right .
60809906	12034	4.0	stephen   king ['] s   horror   books   don ['] t   usually   translate   well   to   the   screen ,    but   kubrick   and   nicholson   between   them   manage   to   leave   king ['] s   potboiler   behind   to   make   this   into   a   worthwhile   thing   in   itself .
60809906	1625	3.0	very   efficient   action   movie ,    presses   all   the   buttions ,    but   not   one   tenth   as   creative   as   the   original .    buy   popcorn ,    sit   back ,    enjoy .
60809906	1865	4.0	amazing !    jim   carrey   in   a   good   movie !    a   nice   balance   between   the   romance   elements   and   the   sci - fi ,    and   none   of   his    ['] comedy [']  !
60809906	3935	5.0	the   best   beatles   film ,    and   they ['] re   only   in   it   for   two   minutes   at   the   end !    great   songs ,    amazing   art .    not   sure   about   the   remaster ,    it   seems   to   have   lost   bits   off   the   edge   of   the   frame   sometimes ,    but   still   great !
60809906	6287	1.0	i   hate   this .    i   hate   anything   with   julia   roberts .
60809906	11301	5.0	no   contest ,    the   best   british   spooky   movie   ever .    fantastically   original ,    great   performances ,    great   ominous   folky   music .    typical   horror   movies   bore   me   silly ,    this   is   utterly   gripping .    the   restored   dvd   director ['] s   cut   makes   a   lot   more   narrative   sense   than   the   stupidly   buchered   theatrical   release .
60809906	3925	3.0	more   of   the   same   with   bigger   computers .
60809906	10828	4.0	good   visuals ,    great   songs .
60809906	11596	2.0	disappointing   disney   effort .    would   have   been   great   if   made   in   the   60 ['] s   with   real   people ,    but   nowadays   they   must   try   harder
60809906	12940	1.0	style   over   substance   all   the   way .    nonsense .
60809906	17133	1.5	where   they   are   spared   ever   having   to   see   setimental   claptrap   like   this .    don   bluth   is   always   rubbish ,    why   does   he   get   his   name   above   the   title ?
60809906	8743	4.5	slapstick   cartoon   humour ,    but   when   it ['] s   done   as   well   as   this   only   the   most   bitter ,    jaded   cynic   could   fail   to   love   it .    some   people   say   the   german   dub   is   funnier .  .  .
60809906	473	4.5	the   film   which   introduced   miyazaki   to   the   west .    full   of   splendour   and   magnificence .    morally   sophisticated :    it ['] s   hard   to   say   who ['] s   the   most   heroic   figure .
60809906	468	1.0	frankly   rubbish .    how   many   hours   of   this   dross   did   i   have   to   sit   through ?
60809906	1433	4.5	iconic ,    touching ,    beautiful .    easily   my   favourite    ['] old   movie [']  .
60809906	6042	3.5	amazingly   not   awful .    in   fact   quite   funny .    in   fact ,    occasionally   screamingly   funny .    made   me   watch   two   other   ben   stiller   movies   which   i   didn ['] t   like ,    so   this   must   have   been   a   fluke .
60809906	8086	3.0	not   as   bad   as   it   looks :    quite   fun   if   you ['] ve   nothing   better   to   do .
60809906	4829	4.0	i ['] m   not   a   fan   of   splatter   horror ,    but   this   is   actually   a   funny   film   with   real   characters .    i   enjoyed   this   much   more   than   i   expected .
60809906	6029	4.0	the   humour   and   style   lighten   what   could   have   been   a   typically   dull   quirky   romcom .    much   better   than   any   british   effort   at   this   genre .
60809906	14149	4.0	could   have   been   awful ,    but   is   actually   rather   good .    i   was   surprised !
60809906	3079	2.5	am   i   the   only   person   who   thinks   elton   johns [']    music   is   appallingly   dull   and   hackneyed   compared   with   the   brilliant   stuff   ashman   and   menken   came   up   with   for   aladdin ,    little   mermaid   and   beauty   and   the   beast .    would   get   4   stars   if   it   had   better   songs .
60809906	6365	1.5	disappointing ,    compared   with   what   ridley   scott   is   capable   of .    it   looks   beautiful ,    but   the   plot   drags   terribly ,    mistaking   violent   action    ( of   which   there   is   plenty )    for   story .    i   quite   liked   gladiator ,    but   this   falls   a   long   way   short .
60809906	7193	4.0	this   was   very   funny   when   it   came   out .    i   wonder   if   it   stands   up .  .  .
60809906	14050	2.0	not   as   good   as   the   new   one .
60809906	3605	1.5	some   people   love   it ,    i   have   trouble   getting   to   the   end .    i   like   the   horese   that   changes   colour .
60809906	14482	4.0	terry   gilliam ['] s   other   good   film .    more   hollywood   than   his   movie   brazil ,    but   still   well   worth   a   look .

298501686	2985	1.5	it ['] s   funny   at   times ,    but   the   plots   kinda   pointless .  .  .
298501686	11077	3.0	this   sequel ,    surprisingly   is   alright ,    but   the   first   one   takes   the   cake .

781801055	16390	4.0	fine - tuned   intensity   and   suspense   built   around   an   ingenious   concept .       a   top - rate   thriller .

781801055	2985	3.0	an   amusing   storyline    +    pre - focker   ben   stiller = worthwhile ,    if   not   overrated   comedy .
781801055	14691	5.0	a   true   achievement   in   filmmaking    &    innovation .       pulls   off   a   revolutionary ,    mind - bending   blend   of   satire ,    cyberpunk ,    kung - fu ,    gunplay ,    philosophy    &    religious   undertones .       the   wachowskis   are   geniuses .
781801055	5226	3.5	funny   with   an   emotional   edge .       brilliant ,    memorable   characters   and   offbeat   humor .       i ['] m   not   totally   sold   on   wes   anderson   yet ,    but   this   was   definitely   a   solid   effort .
781801055	10561	0.5	though   it   doesn ['] t   feature   many   redeeming   qualities ,    rent   this   one   and   watch   it   with   your   friends .       it ['] s   a   riot   for   all   the   wrong   reasons .
781801055	2743	4.0	recounts   the   sheer   cruelty   and   barbarity   of   war   from   an   endearing   personal   perspective .       very   unsettling ,    but   the   film   is   a   beautiful   testament   to   the   conviction   of   the   human   soul ,    even   in   the   most   miserable   of   circumstances .
781801055	10170	1.5	recycled   frat   jokes   and   hammed    " emotional / sentimental "    sequences = ugh .       it ['] s   one   of   those   movies   you   know   will   be   awful ,    but   you   do   it   for   the   experience   anyway .
781801055	673	3.0	probably   one   of   the   most   unique   movies   out   there .       the   themes   of   anti - consumerism   and      nihilism   are   well - conveyed   throughout   the   film ,    but   the   whole   project   mayhem   bit   sank   it   for   me .       there ['] s   nothing   quite   like   watching   ed   norton   throw   himself   down   a   flight   of   stairs .
781801055	12785	4.0	successfully   brought   about   the   21st   century   comic   book   renaissance .       i   was   apprehensive   about   this   one ,    but   the   cast   really   captured   the   spirit   of   the   legendary   characters   for   the   most   part .       watchable   again    &    again .
781801055	17479	3.5	everyone   harps   on   it ,    but   i   thought   it   was   a   different   concept   in   the   genre   that   was   solidly ,    if   not   spectacularly ,    executed .       loses   a   point   for   the   sequel   and   for   the   wave   of   americanized   japanese   horror   films   it   inspired .
781801055	15887	1.5	hugh   jackman -  - you   just   nailed   your   performance   as   wolverine .       and   what   do   you   do ?       make   this   clunker   of   a   film .       gets   deathly   close   to    ['] xxx [']    level   of   cheese   and   all - around   level   of   brain - numbing   awfulness .
781801055	4384	3.5	plenty   of   suspense ,    scares   and   twists   make   this   one   a   pretty   entertaining   zombie   film .    very   well   crafted   and   executed ,    but   there ['] s   something   missing   that   prevents   it   from   achieving   greatness .
781801055	10583	1.0	it   seemed   to   ride   the   classic   rock   revival   of   the   early   2000s   to   its   wave   of   acclaim .       aside   from   a   few   memorable   one - liners ,    jack   black ['] s   character   was   pretty   unlikable   throughout   the   whole   ordeal .       way   overrated .
781801055	17187	2.5	maybe   i ['] d   like   it   better   if   i   originally   saw   it   as   a   kid ,    but   i   just   don ['] t   see   how   tbs   can   air   this   24   hours   straight .       cute   for   the   holidays ,    but   i   expected   a   lot   more .
781801055	17324	2.5	good   for   a   few   laughs   and   a   couple   typical   will   smith   moments    (  " awww ,    helll   no !  "  )  ,    but   rather   predicatable .

781801055	7057	3.0	the   anti - empire   strikes   back .       by   far ,    the   weakest   of   the   trilogy .       throws   too   many   new   characters   into   the   mix   for   non - tolkein   fans .       saruman ['] s   defeat   is   as   anti - climactic   as   helm ['] s   deep   is   overrated .
781801055	6400	4.0	charming ,    witty ,    and   entertaining .       leonardo   dicaprio    +    tom   hanks    =    cinematic   gold .

781801055	5862	4.5	what   incredible   concept   and   execution .       a   top - notch   thriller   that   warrants   another   viewing - it ['] s   one   you   won ['] t   forget   so   quickly .

781801055	3900	3.0	masterfully   acted   and   assembled -  -       very   gritty   film .       underwhelming   at   times   though .

781801055	5793	4.0	kind   of   like   a   gothic   matrix   without   all   of   the   cyberpunk    &    bullet - dodging .       that ['] s   a   compliment ,    by   the   way .       very ,    very   stylish .

781801055	12690	4.0	martial   arts   captured   in   all   of   its   frenzied ,    kinetic   motion .       the   vibrant   colors   result   in   a   real   artistic   flair -  - the   outcome   is   a   living ,    breathing   poetic   tale   of   swords   and   souls .
781801055	17088	4.5	a   comedy   classic .       easy   to   relate   to   with   all   of   the   awkward   moments   and   struggles .       manages   to   be   both   charming   and   hilarious ,    but   not   in   an   over - the - top   way .
781801055	16969	3.5	ambitious   to   say   the   least -  - quite   possibly   one   of   the   most   challenging   thinking   films   in   recent   memory .       subplots   involving   literature ,    religion ,    time   travel ,    alternate   realities    &    coming - of - age   all   wrapped   up   in   one   movie .       certainly   warrants   multiple   viewings .
781801055	4171	3.0	surprisingly   violent   spoof   overloaded   with   camp   and   cheese .       maybe   too   ahead   of   its   time ?
781801055	3385	3.0	fresh ,    novel   approach   to   the   zombie   genre   by   danny   boyle .    beautiful   camera   work ,    but   the   third   act   with   the   soldiers   disappointed   because   it   hurt   the   tension   created   through   isolation .       i   wish   the   plot   would   have   taken   a   cue   from   the   rage - infected   brits   and   been   a   little   more   unrelenting ,    but   a   solid   flick   nonetheless .
781801055	2422	2.5	really ,    really   wanted   to   like   this   one ,    but   i   felt   like   i   had   to   put   too   much   into   concentrating   on   every   minute   detail   to   fully   enjoy   it .       maybe   i ['] ll   give   it   a   second   shot   someday .

781801055	3864	4.0	definitely   not   a   standard   superhero   movie   in   any   form .       chris   nolan   and   his   as - always   stunning   vision   singlehandledly   resurrected   the   franchise .       bravo .

759272928	14712	4.0	k   i   c   k   a   s   s    .     .     .    that   is   all .
785621036	5705	3.5	i   enjoyed   this .    i   was   struck   by   the    " feel "    of   the   film    -    i   knew   i   was   watching   star   wars ,    rather   than   star   trek .    in   one   of   the   original   three   films ,    luke   is   told   that   he ['] s   only   starting   to   understand   what   he ['] s   capable   of    ( with   his   jedi   powers )  .    in   this   film ,    yoda   reveals   a   whole   lot   more   of   that   iceberg !
785621036	686	3.5	simply   put ,    i   enjoyed   it .    it ['] s   not   exactly   one   of   the   classics ,    but   it   was   fun .    the   basic   plot   device    ( genie   twists   wishes   to   mess   things   up )    has   been   done   before ,    but   that ['] s   ok   as   long   as   the   actual   implementation    ( i . e .    the   way   the   wishes   get   messed   up )    is   original ,    which   i   thought   they   were .    liz   hurley ['] s   character   was   interesting    -    she   reminded   me   of   spike   from    " buffy "  ,    in   that   while   her   actions   were   morally   reprehensible ,    she   was   witty   and   likeable .
785621036	551	3.0	this   was   surprisingly   entertaining ,    if   you   don ['] t   mind   dubious   puns .    e . g .     " what ['] s   that ?  "     ( referring   to   glass   globe   on   a   red / white   striped   stick   in   the   snow )     " it ['] s   the   north   pole .  "
785621036	14590	3.5	i   enjoyed   this   in   the   cinema ,    and   it   stood   up   well   to   a   second   watching   12   years   on .    it ['] s   different   to   the   first   film ,    but   i   think   that ['] s   a   good   thing ;    too   many   sequels   are   just   inferior   rehashes   of   the   same   plot .    there   are   some   nice   puzzles   to   keep   your   brain   working ,    realistic   characters ,    and   plenty   of   action   scenes .    i   particularly   liked   the   bit   where   they   rejected   a   jump   on   the   grounds   that   it   was   too   dangerous ,    so   found   a   different   approach .
785621036	5496	2.5	i   quite   liked   this ,    although   it   does   have   some   stupid   bits ,    and   you ['] d   be   better   off   reading   the   original   asimov   stories .
785621036	14691	4.0	definitely   the   best   film   of   the   trilogy :    intelligent   and   action - packed .
785621036	6196	3.5	it   looks   a   bit   dated   now ,    but   this   was   a   great   film   for   its   time ,    and   laid   the   groundwork   for   better   things   to   come .
785621036	1905	4.0	i   really   enjoyed   this   film    -    it   was   a   lot   better   than   i ['] d   expected   it   to   be .    i ['] ve   now   seen   it   several   times    ( and   bought   the   soundtrack )  ,    and   i   definitely   think   it ['] s   the   best   of   the   three .
785621036	15058	3.5	i   enjoyed   this ;    it ['] s   not   quite   as   good   as    " four   weddings "  ,    but   i ['] m   still   happy   to   re - watch   it .    the   romance   is   a   bit   iffy    ( i   don ['] t   know   what   he   sees   in   her )  ,    but   it   has   lots   of   funny   scenes ,    particularly   the    " horse   and   hound "    interviews .
785621036	15409	3.0	this   was   a   lot   of   fun    -    not   exactly   sophisticated   humour ,    but   it   made   me   laugh .    it   was   also   interesting   to   see   michelle   trachtenberg    ( dawn   from    " buffy "  )    and   kristin   kreuk    ( lana   from    " smallville "  )    in   very   different   roles .
785621036	8809	3.0	i   was   a   bit   wary   about   this ,    as   almost   all   the   comments   i ['] d   heard   on   the   internet   about   it   had   been   negative .    still ,    it ['] s    " star   trek "  ,    so   i   could   hardly   not   watch   it .  .  .    basically ,    i   thought   it   was   ok .    not   the   greatest   trek   film   ever ,    but   certainly   worth   watching .    they   had   some   good   ideas ,    and   some   stupid   ideas ,    and   i   did   feel   a   few   times   that   the   concepts   they   were   exploring   had   been   handled   better   elswhere .
785621036	3533	2.0	this   was   ok ,    although   not   as   good   as   the    " south   park "    movie .    it   didn ['] t   offend   me   or   anything ,    but   it   only   made   me   smile   rather   than   laugh ,    so   it   didn ['] t   pass   my   litmus   test   for   comedy .
785621036	3938	3.5	i   enjoyed   this ,    so   i ['] d   definitely   recommend   it   to   anyone   who   enjoyed   the   first   film .    my   rule   of   thumb   for   good   comedy   is    " does   it   make   me   laugh ?  "    early   on ,    there   was   a   lot   of   stuff   that   was   clever ,    and   that   made   me   smile ,    but   it   wasn ['] t   raucously   funny .    but   by   the   end   i   was   laughing   out   loud ,    so   that ['] s   good .    i   also   thought   that   the   ending   was   quite   moving .    and   the   animation   was   very   well - done :    if   i   didn ['] t   know   better ,    i   would   have   thought   that   the   opening   sequence    ( on   horseback )    was   live - action .
785621036	6687	3.0	this   was   entertaining .    not   the   greatest   film   ever   made ,    but   pretty   much   what   you   expect   from   the   genre    ( alien - esque ,    bunch   of   humans   trying   to   survive   against   nasty   predators )  .
785621036	12785	3.5	this   film   does   a   good   job   of   introducing   all   the   key   characters ,    while   still   telling   a   complete   story .    i   particularly   liked   the   chess   game   between   xavier   and   magneto ,    and   the   film   was   lucky   to   get   actors   of   their   calibre .
785621036	10168	2.5	i   quite   enjoyed   it    -    it   doesn ['] t   have   much   in   common   with   the   comic    ( which   i   also   liked )  ,    but   that ['] s   ok .    i   treat   them   as   alternate   divergences   from   a   common   starting   point    ( i . e .    the   original   literature )  .       i   do   wonder   whether   there   will   be   children    ( or   even   adults )    who   say    " oh ,    that   hyde   bloke   is   a   complete   hulk   ripoff "  ,    but   that ['] s   probably   just   me   being   elitist .    visually ,    it   was   very   impressive ,    particularly   the   special   effects   for   the   invisible   man .    and   there ['] s   a   reasonable   story   there   too    ( by   the   standards   of   summer   blockbusters )  ,    although   i   did   get   a   bit   confused   about   what   they   were   trying   to   achieve   at   one   point .       one   main   difference   in   approach   between   the   comic   and   the   film   is   that   the   film   spells   things   out   a   lot   more .    e . g .    it   doesn ['] t   matter   whether   you ['] ve   heard   of   dorian   gray ,    since   you   are   told   explicitly   what ['] s   special   about   him .    by   contrast ,    the   comic   often   left   me   with   the   feeling   of    " wow ,    alan   moore   is   a   lot   smarter   than   i   am ,    and   i   really   should   read   more   of   these   classics   of   literature   so   that   i   can   keep   up "  .    i   don ['] t   resent   that ,    and   it ['] s   probably   a   good   influence   on   me    ( not   that   i ['] ve   actually   read   any   of   the   source   material   since   reading   the   comic ,    admittedly )  ,    but   having   things   spoon - fed   to   me   does   make   for   a   relaxing   change   of   pace .
785621036	15887	3.0	this   is   a   fun   film ,    with   some   catchy   music    ( particularly    " transylvanian   horses "  )  .    interestingly ,    i   think   the   way   frankenstein ['] s   monster   was   portrayed   is   a   lot   closer   to   the   original   novel   than   most   of   the   old   black   and   white   films .
785621036	13610	3.5	this   is   a   good   story ,    with   great   casting .    it   does   suffer   a   bit   on   repeated   viewings ,    but   there   are   still   some   memorable   moments .    actually ,    i   really   like   re - watching   the   trailer   for   this   film .     (  " who   am   i ?    i ['] m   spider - man !  "  )
785621036	13488	2.5	i   thought   this   was   quite   entertaining ,    although   it   wasn ['] t   as   good   as   i ['] d   expected .    there   were   some   interesting   ideas ,    and   a   twist   near   the   end   which   surprised   me .
785621036	17499	4.0	a   fun   film ,    that   i   can   watch   over   and   over   again .    it   has   some   catchy   tunes ,    so   i   sometimes   just   skip   through   to   watch   them .    it   can   be   a   bit   jarring   when   the   tone   shifts   abruptly   between   comedy   and   death / destruction ,    but   they   avoid   showing   any   real   brutality   directly .
785621036	10583	3.5	it   rocked !    i   think   that   this   is   the   role   jack   black   was   born   to   play ;    i ['] m   not   a   huge   fan   of   rock   music   myself ,    but   i   admire   his   passion .
785621036	2457	3.5	it ['] s   harmless   fluff ,    but   it ['] s   quite   fun ,    with   a   nice   message   behind   it .    the   lead   characters   are   a   bit   insipid ,    but   the   supporting   cast   make   it   worth   watching    ( particularly   jennifer   coolidge   as   the   stepmother )  .       i   often   skip   the   commentaries   etc .    on   dvds ,    but   in   this   case   i   do   recommend   them :    i   was   impressed   at   how   much   thought   went   into   it ,    e . g .    the   costume   designer   saying   that   she   had   to   come   up   with   100   different   fancy   dress   costumes   for   a   particular   part   of   the   film .
785621036	3962	4.0	i   liked   this .    i ['] ve   noticed   that   disney   films   are   generally   able   to   push   my   buttons    ( emotionally   speaking )    when   it   comes   to   themes   about   families .    it ['] s   worth   sticking   around   until   the   end   of   the   credits ,    as   there   are   a   couple   of   amusing   things   that   appear .
785621036	7067	3.0	another   fun   film ,    much   like   the   first .    sample   quote   from   a   friend   in   the   cinema :     " why   are   they   naked ?  "
785621036	10027	5.0	this   film   is   one   of   the   classics ,    and   i ['] ve   lost   count   of   how   many   times   i ['] ve   seen   it ;    that   makes   it   slightly   tricky   to   review ,    because   now   i ['] m   so   familiar   with   it   that   some   scenes   have   lost   their   initial   impact .       notable   points   include   the   battle   in   the   mutara   nebula :    this   is   one   of   the   rare   times   when   we   actually   see   strategy   in   a   space   battle ,    rather   than   two   ships   pounding   on   each   other ['] s   shields   until   one   gives   way .    similarly ,    the   kobayashi   maru   scenario    ( and   kirk ['] s   solution )    created   echoes   which   are   still   being   heard   today ,    particularly   in   the   novels   which   show   how   other   characters   handled   that   dilemma .       as   for   the   ending ,    there   are   a   couple   of   subtle   points   which   i   missed   the   first   time   around ,    and   they   add   pathos ;    when   spock   abruptly   leaves   the   bridge ,    you   know   that   he ['] s   made   his   decision ,    even   though   kirk   is   unaware   of   it .    as   the   saying   goes ,     " greater   love   hath   no   man   than   this ,    that   he   lays   down   his   life   for   his   friends .  "    if   you   don ['] t   shed   a   tear   at   the   end   of   this   film ,    there ['] s   something   wrong   with   you .
785621036	11669	3.0	this   was   a   much   quieter   film   than   i ['] d   expected ,    but   it   worked   well .    although   the   title   was   what   attracted   me   to   the   film   in   the   first   place ,    it   might   have   worked   better   without   the   supernatural   aspects ,    just   to   embrace   the   weirdness   of   the   main   characters .    in   a   way ,    this   film   is   a   bit   like    " cocoon "  ,    but   aimed   at   a   different   audience .
785621036	17324	4.0	i   really   enjoyed   this    -    very   funny ,    and   it   had   some   useful   advice    ( the   only   bit   i   really   disagreed   with   turned   out   to   be   a   deliberate   mistake )  .
785621036	2463	4.0	this   was   very   good ,    striking   the   right   balance   between   comedy   and   serious   scenes    ( where   they   managed   to   convey   a   real   sense   of   danger )  .    the   cgi   was   very   good   too ,    particularly   where   it   involved   water .
785621036	4149	4.0	i   enjoyed   this :    it ['] s   a   fun   film ,    and   i ['] d   definitely   recommend   it   to   anyone   who   liked   the   first   one .       there   are   different   ways   to   handle   film   sequels .    you   want   to   be   similar   to   the   original ,    without   being   a   complete   copy .    i   think    " toy   story   2 "    was   a   great   example   of   how   to   do   it   right ,    whereas    " austin   powers   2 "    was   just   a   rehash   of   the   first   one .    scooby   doo   2   did   it   well ;    the   characters   are   familiar ,    but   this   story   is   different   to   the   first   film .    and   as   with   the   first   film ,    the   casting   is   spot   on .       speaking   of   similarities ,    there ['] s   an   impressive   amount   of   continuity   in   here   with   the   old   cartoon   series ,    but   it ['] s   handled   well ;    you   don ['] t   need   to   have   seen   the   original   episodes   to   understand   anything .    for   instance ,    i ['] m   pretty   sure   that   a   couple   of   the   things   they   mention   in   the   film    ( e . g .    shaggy ['] s   real   name )    only   came   up   in    " a   pup   named   scooby   doo "  .    so ,    that   certainly   implies   that   the   people   who   made   this   have   done   their   homework .       mind   you ,    when   they   showed   fans   in   the   film ,    it   was   a   bit   like   the   first   half - hour   of    " galaxy   quest "  ;    uncomfortably   true   to   life .    i   guess   there   are   levels   of   cult - following   behaviour ,    and   it ['] s   only   a   problem   when   people   start   defining   themselves   in   terms   of   their   obsession .       as   for   the   jokes ,    i   wouldn ['] t   exactly   say   that   they   worked   on   multiple   levels .    but   there   was   some   variety   there .    listening   to   other   people   in   the   cinema   with   me ,    the   things   that   made   me   laugh    (  " to   museums !  "  )    were   different   from   the   things   that   made   the   young   children   laugh    ( e . g .    fart   jokes )  .    so ,    i   think   there ['] s   something   for   everyone   there .       there   were   some   interesting   scenes   when   they   played   with   the   group   dynamics   a   bit    ( e . g .    daphne   and   velma   working   as   a   pair )  ,    and   there   was   one   scene   that   i   found   genuinely   moving .    overall ,    i   think   that   the   general   theme   of   this   film   was   growth .       as   for   the   mystery ,    i   won ['] t   give   away   the   ending .    all   i ['] ll   say   is   that   i   only   figured   out   part   of   it .
785621036	28	4.0	this   was   fun .    it ['] s   a   bit   different   to   the   other   animated   disney   films   i ['] ve   seen ,    e . g .    it ['] s   set   in   the   present   day ,    and   not   based   on   a   fairy   tale ,    but   i   really   enjoyed   it .     ( the   spin - off   tv   series   is   also   good .  )
785621036	8429	4.0	if   you   like   the   way   that   death   is   portrayed   in   the   discworld   novels   then   this   film   should   appeal   to   you .
785621036	5317	4.0	this   a   fun   film ,    which   made   me   laugh   a   lot .    it   even   has   william   shatner   singing    -    what   more   could   you   ask   for ?
785621036	8771	3.5	this   is   an   interesting   one .    i   liked   the   original   film ,    but   the   first   sequel   fell   into   the   standard    " sequel - itis "    trap ,    i . e .    re - hashing   the   original   version   and   not   doing   it   quite   as   well .    it   had   a   couple   of   good   bits ,    but   it ['] s   not   something   i ['] d   advise   going   out   of   your   way   for .    this   film ,    on   the   other   hand ,    takes   a   very   different   approach .    when   i   saw   the   original   trailer   for   it ,    i   thought   it   was   just   going   to   expand   the   montage   section   where   simba   is   growing   up   with   timon   and   pumba .    that   did   happen ,    but   the   main   point   of   the   film   was   to   do   a    " forrest   gump "    thing   with   timon   and   pumba   showing   up   at   various   points   during   the   original   film .    actually ,    a   better   comparison   may   be   the   ds9   tribbles   episode ,    where   it ['] s   intercut   with   scenes   from   the   original   tos   episode .    it ['] s   very   much   a   comedy ,    and   any   serious   themes   tend   to   get   undercut   quite   quickly .    personally ,    i   thought   it   was   very   funny .    you   need   to   have   seen   the   original   film   for   it   to   make   sense ,    but   i ['] d   recommend   to   it   to   anyone   who   did   like   the   first   one .    you   don ['] t   need   to   have   seen   the   second   one ,    since   there   are   no   references   to   it   whatsoever .
785621036	3197	3.5	i   think   the   trailer   is   actually   a   pretty   fair   advert   for   the   film    -    not   that   it   gives   away   the   entire   plot ,    but   it   will   serve   as   a   good   indication   of   whether   you ['] ll   like   the   film   or   not .       there   are   certainly   some   major   differences   between   this   and   previous   versions   of   the   story    ( the   book ,    the   david   niven   film ,    and   the   animated   series   with   the   lion )  ,    and   to   quote   jack   sparrow :     " either   you   can   accept   that ,    or   you   can ['] t "  .       taken   on   its   own   merits ,    i   thought   that   it   was   funny    ( mostly   slapstick   humour   rather   than   anything   more   sophisticated ,    but   it   made   me   laugh )    and   it   appealed   to   my   values .    not   the   greatest   film   ever   made ,    but   it   was   an   entertaining   way   to   spend   a   few   hours ,    which   is   what   i   was   looking   for .
785621036	5862	3.5	a   clever   film ,    very   well   acted .    you   have   to   pay   close   attention ,    but   it ['] s   worth   the   effort .    i   think   it   benefits   from   being   watched   at   home    ( rather   than   on   the   big   screen )  ,    so   that   you   can   pause   the   dvd   every   so   often   and   collect   your   thoughts .
785621036	2342	3.5	an   interesting   film .    i   have   a   few   quibbles   about   his   methodology ,    but   i   admire   him   for   sticking   to   his   rules   once   he ['] d   defined   them ,    even   when   it   was   causing   him   damage .    definitely   worth   watching   if   you   ever   eat   at   mcdonalds !
785621036	17308	2.5	this   was   better   than   i   expected ;    it ['] s   never   going   to   be   one   of   the   classics ,    but   it   passed   the   time   nicely   while   i   was   sewing .    there   are   some   funny   scenes ,    and    ( despite   first   impressions )    the   lead   character   is   just   so   nice   that   i   can ['] t   help   rooting   for   her .
785621036	14131	2.5	this   is   actually   quite   funny .    not   one   of   your   all - time   classics ,    but   a   pleasant   diversion   for   a   couple   of   hours .    if   nothing   else ,    it ['] s   worth   watching   the   end   credits ,    which   have   a   song   performed   by   various   real - life   former   child   stars    ( e . g .    the   two   coreys   from    " lost   boys "  )  .
785621036	16912	3.0	this   was   fun .    great   dialogue   from   that    ( between   two   of   the   chickens )  :     " i ['] m   from   the   land   of   the   free   and   the   home   of   the   brave !  "     " scotland ?  "     " no ,    america !  "
785621036	11696	3.5	for   the   first   half   hour ,    i   thought   that   it   was   quite   an   accurate   depiction   of   sf   conventions ,    but   that   didn ['] t   actually   make   it   funny .    however ,    things   got   a   lot   better   when   the   characters   went   into   space ,    and   i   almost   fell   off   my   seat   with   laughter   during   the    " leaving   spacedock "    scene .    it   doesn ['] t   stand   up   quite   so   well   to   repeated   viewings ,    but   definitely   worth   watching   once .
785621036	13050	3.0	this   was   entertaining .    as   with   most   films   of   this   genre ,    the   journey   is   more   important   than   the   destination .
785621036	6552	3.0	this   is   a   fun   film    -    not   exactly   cerebral ,    but   entertaining .    admittedly ,    the   term    " jiggle   movie "    does   have   some   accuracy .  .  .    quote   from   the   director   on   explosions :     " more   is   more !  "
785621036	13342	3.0	this   was   fun .
785621036	5571	1.5	this   led   to   the   greatness   that   was    " rocky   iii "    and    " rocky   iv "  ,    but   taken   on   its   own   merits   it   was   pretty   dull .     ( in   fairness ,    i   haven ['] t   seen   it   since   i   was   a   kid ,    so   i   might   rate   it   differently   now .  )
785621036	6287	4.0	a   fun   film ,    that   i   can   just   watch   over   and   over   again .

785621036	7509	2.5	i   enjoyed   this .    it   was   pretty   much   what   i   expected   from   a   bond   film    -    stupid ,    but   entertaining .    and   very   loud !    mind   you ,    i   didn ['] t   think   much   of   madonna ['] s   theme   tune    -    it ['] s   the   first   time   i ['] ve   seen   a   bond   film   and   thought    " hurry   up   and   finish   the   credits   so   we   can   get   on   with   the   main   film "  .
785621036	897	3.0	i   thought   this   was   great .    it   took   me   a   little   while   to   get   used   to   the   genre   convention   of   people   breaking   into   song   spontaneously ,    but    " no   wife ,    no   life "    was   extremely   funny .
785621036	3925	3.0	i   liked   the   film    -    i   thought   it   was   decent ,    and   a   fun   way   to   spend   a   couple   of   hours .    however ,    it   could   have   been   better    -    i   was   much   more   interested   in   the   plot   developments   than   the   action   scenes ,    which   often   seemed   gratuitous .
785621036	205	3.5	i   enjoyed   this .    there   were   changes   to   the   original   stories ,    but   the   only   one   i   really   noticed   was   the   time   compression    -    the   entire   war   now   seemed   to   take   a   couple   of   weeks ,    rather   than   10   years .    aside   from   that ,    everything   i   remembered   was   in   it ,    i . e .    all   the   moments   that   i   was   hoping   to   see .    i   particularly   liked   the   cameo   from   aeneas   at   the   end    ( the   protagonist   in   virgil ['] s    " aeneid "  )  .       the   fight   scenes   were   impressive ,    and   there   were   likeable   characters   on   both   sides ,    with   human   failings .
785621036	11182	3.5	i   liked   this ,    although   it   wasn ['] t   quite   what   i   was   expecting .    basically ,    it ['] s   not   really   an   action   film ,    although   there   are   action   bits   in   it .    it ['] s   a   lot   more   character   driven   than   plot   driven ,    and   i   found   it   quite   interesting .       i   tried   reading   the   novel   afterwards ,    but   i   was   so   bored   that   i   gave   up   half   way   through .    i   think   this   story   works   better   as   a   film ,    so   that   you   can   see   the   ship   rather   than   reading   a   long   description   of   the   sails   and   rigging .
785621036	7227	3.0	i   didn ['] t   rush   off   to   see   this ,    because   i   thought   it   looked   pretty   stupid   in   the   posters .    i   was   aware   that   it   was   based   on   a   comic ,    but   it ['] s   not   a   comic   i ['] ve   ever   read ,    so   that   wasn ['] t   much   of   an   incentive .    however ,    other   people   were   enthusiastic ,    and   i   enjoyed   it .    i   think   it   basically   worked   as   a   comedy   rather   than   an   action / adventure   film ,    but   that ['] s   ok ,    and   i   wound   up   reading   one   of   the   comics   as   a   result .
785621036	17692	4.0	" let ['] s   get   jinky   with   it !  "    this   is   a   fun   film ,    with   great   casting    ( particularly   shaggy )  ,    and   it   does   a   nice   job   of   blurring   the   edges   between   scooby ['] s   canine   and   human   characteristics .
785621036	15107	3.0	nothing   special ,    but   a   pleasant   way   to   pass   some   time ,    and   they   did   have   a   clever   twist   near   the   end .
785621036	9960	4.0	the   first   18   certificate   film   i   saw    ( back   when   i   was   at   school )  ,    and   it   blew   me   away .    very   tense ,    with   an   action   hero   who   bleeds .
785621036	468	3.5	i   thought   this   was   much   better   than   the   second   matrix   film ,    although   my   lower   expectations   may   have   helped .    this   film   did   seem   to   be   much   more   closely   tied   to   the   second   than   either   of   them   were   to   the   first .
785621036	15953	4.0	it ['] s   not   exactly   hard   sf ,    but   it   is   fun ,    and   i ['] ve   watched   it   several   times .
785621036	1983	1.0	i   watched   this   in   the   cinema ,    and   basically   thought    " very   pretty ,    shame   about   the   story "  .    nowadays ,    the   cgi   may   not   seem   that   impressive ,    so   it   doesn ['] t   really   have   anything   to   recommend   it .       the   main   issue   is   whether   you   believe   the   whole    " gaia "    business ,    i . e .    the   idea   that   the   earth   is   actually   alive .    frankly ,    i   sided   with   the   antagonist    ( military   guy )    when   he   said   that   he   wasn ['] t   willing   to   risk   the   entire   planet   without   some   form   of   proof   that   aki ['] s   theory   was   correct .
785621036	4472	3.5	i   liked   this    -    it   was   entertaining ,    and   heartwarming .    pretty   much   what   you ['] d   expect ,    really .    there ['] s   a   large   cast ,    so   lots   of   small   stories ,    but   they   all   get   enough   space ,    and   weave   together   nicely .    i   couldn ['] t   tell   you   many   of   the   names   of   characters ,    but   i   recognised   them   enough   to   keep   track   of   who   was   who .    and   the   children   in   the   film   avoid   being   overly   cute   or   precocious .       one   note   of   caution ,    though    -    i   know   some   people   get   a   bit   disappointed   when   a   film   is   billed   as   a   comedy ,    and   actually   turns   out   to   be   more   of   a   drama    (  " east   is   east "    being   a   good   example   of   that )  .    there   are   some   serious   parts   in   this   film ,    and   i ['] d   say   that   it ['] s   closer   to    " sliding   doors "    than   it   is   to    " four   weddings   and   a   funeral "  .    i   don ['] t   think   that ['] s   a   bad   thing ,    but   you   may   want   to   modify   your   expectations   accordingly .
785621036	13894	3.0	it ['] s   an   interesting   film ;    since   a   lot   of   it   is   silent ,    you   do   need   to   give   it   your   full   attention   rather   than   just   leaving   the   tv   on   in   the   background .
785621036	4829	3.5	i   enjoyed   this ,    particularly   the   idea   that   it   would   take   people   a   while   to   notice   that   zombies   were   roaming   around .    mind   you ,    even   though   it ['] s   a   comedy ,    there   were   a   couple   of   things   that   made   me   jump .
785621036	14644	1.5	it   was   ok ,    but   nothing   special ,    so   i   wouldn ['] t   really   recommend   it .    if   you   know   about   the   key   plot   from   the   first   film    ( which   i   haven ['] t   actually   seen )  ,    then   it ['] s   not   much   of   a   spoiler ,    since   it   is   revealed   very   quickly   in   this   one .       it   was   amusing ,    although   it   didn ['] t   pass   my   laughter   test   for   comedy .    it   had   some   interesting   points ,    but   also   had   some   huge   plot   holes .    and   it   wasn ['] t   exactly   subtle ,    which   is   either   good   or   bad   depending   on   your   point   of   view .
785621036	17008	4.0	i   really   enjoyed   this   film .    i ['] ve   heard   people   say   that   the   tennis   aspects   are   unrealistic ,    but   since   i ['] m   not   a   sports   fan   that   doesn ['] t   bother   me   at   all .    the   romantic   bits   were   heartwarming ,    and   the   comedy   bits   were   funny ,    so   that ['] s   what   i   was   looking   for .
785621036	11337	3.0	better   than   i ['] d   expected ,    and   jim ['] s   dad   was   definitely   the   best   character .
785621036	15871	3.0	i   was   dubious   about   this   at   first ,    but   it   was   surprisingly   good .    obviously   the   plot   is   ludicrous ,    but   it ['] s   fun .    i   enjoyed    " the   love   bug "    when   i   was   a   kid ,    and   i ['] d   say   that   this   film   is   equally   good .
785621036	334	2.5	my   immediate   reaction   was   to   think   of   the   zonar   review   i   read   a   while   back    (  " gracious ,    but   vin   diesel   has   gotten   to   the   kindergarten   cop   phase   of   his   career   rather   quickly   hasn ['] t   he ?  "  )  .    however ,    while   it ['] s   easy   to   sneer ,    this   film   was   actually   quite   funny .
785621036	1962	3.0	i   was   pretty   dubious   about   this   film   at   first ,    particularly   after   watching    " 12 : 01 "  ;    surely   they ['] d   have   to   ignore   the   plausible   consequences   or   turn   it   into   a   really   bleak   film .    however ,    they   found   another   approach ,    and   it   worked   well .
785621036	2167	3.0	this   film   is   genuinely   heartwarming ,    so   well   worth   watching .
785621036	16113	3.0	a   decent   sequel ,    which   kept   me   entertained ,    although   i   think   that   on   balance   the   first   film   was   better .
785621036	851	4.0	a   satisfying   end   to   the   trilogy .
785621036	13391	3.5	this   is   a   fun   film ,    which   nicely   filled   the   gap   between   bond   films   when   it   first   came   out .    it ['] s   ludicrous   in   many   places ,    but   it   still   leaves   me   with   a   big   grin   on   my   face .    actually ,    although   arnie   is   the   nominal   hero ,    i   think   eliza   dushku ['] s   character   comes   across   the   best    -    she   does   brave   things   when   it ['] s   clear   that   she ['] s   very   scared .
785621036	9800	2.5	a   harmless   enough   diversion ,    although   it ['] s   just   amusing   rather   than   funny .    they   did   put   some   thought   into   their   rules ,    so   there ['] s   a   bit   more   to   it   than   you ['] d   guess   from   the   trailer .
785621036	5401	3.0	this   was   one   of   those   films   that   i   avoided   when   it   came   out   at   the   cinema ,    because   it   looked   pretty   dire ,    but   i   decided   to   watch   it   on   tv   on   a   whim ,    and   it   turned   out   to   be   surprisingly   good .    basically ,    it ['] s   funny   because   it ['] s   so   ridiculously   over   the   top .    for   instance ,    one   training   session   involved   the   team   dashing   across   a   busy   road :     " if   you   can   dodge   cars ,    you   can   dodge   balls !  "    similarly ,    i ['] d   say   that   the   violence   falls   into   the   realm   of   cartoon   violence .    admittedly ,    it ['] s   not   sophisticated   humour ,    but   it   made   me   laugh .    i ['] m   still   not   quite   sure   that   i   understand   the   rules   of   the   game ,    but   people   who ['] ve   grown   up   with   it   probably   do .       other   highlights   of   the   film   included   some   nice   cameos    ( e . g .    david   hasselhoff   following   up   on   his   success   in    " eurotrip "  )  ,    and   alan   tudyk    ( wash   from    " firefly "  )    as   a   pirate    -    y ['] arr !    between   this   film ,     " i   robot "  ,    and    " a   knight ['] s   tale "  ,    he ['] s   actually   displayed   quite   an   impressive   range .
785621036	11745	3.0	i   enjoyed   this .    i   was   looking   forward   to   it ,    although   i ['] d   heard   some   bad   comments   about   it   from   other   people   who ['] d   seen   it ,    so   i   had   mixed   expectations .    it ['] s   probably   not   a   film   i ['] d   buy   on   dvd ,    but   i   thought   it   was   good .    my   main   reservation   about    " daredevil "    was   that   they ['] d   gone   overboard   on   the   superpowers ,    but   the   mystic   aspects   in   this   film   didn ['] t   bother   me    -    less   detached   than    " crouching   tiger ,    hidden   dragon "  ,    but   more   grounded   than    " bulletproof   monk "     ( which   was   a   fun   film )  .    probably   the   best   compliment   i   can   give   is   that   i   hadn ['] t   finished   my   drink   by   the   end   of   the   film ,    because   there   were   hardly   any   points   when   i ['] d   feel   comfortable   making   a   noise .    i   really   should   get   round   to   watching    " alias "    sometime ,    to   see   more   of   jennifer   garner ['] s   work .  .  .
785621036	5793	3.0	i   enjoyed   this .    i ['] ll   probably   watch   it   again   at   some   point ,    although   it ['] s   not   something   i ['] d   want   to   own   a   copy   of .    it ['] s   entertaining ,    with   some   nifty   ideas ,    although   some   of   the   characterisation   is   a   bit   iffy .
785621036	8108	4.0	i   enjoyed   this ,    and   it   stands   up   to   repeat   viewings .    i   think   my   favourite   characters   were   the   two   teenage    (  ?  )    monsters .     " shut   up !    you ['] re   making   it   worse !  "
785621036	17714	5.0	this   is   one   of   those   classic   films   that   i   can   just   watch   over   and   over   again .    my   favourite    " song "    is   the   one   without   words    -    the    " aa   aa   aa "    one .    it ['] s   not   just   a   tune ,    since   there   is   a   vocal   component   to   it ,    but   i ['] m   not   sure   whether   it   actually   counts   as   a   song .       even   after   multiple   viewings ,    there   are   still   a   couple   of   scenes   that   always   impress   me .    i   find   the   first   mermaid   to   human   transformation   quite   moving ,    because   of   how   flounder   and   sebastian   act .    they   told   ariel   not   to   go   to   the   sea   witch ,    because   they   thought   it   would   turn   out   badly .    she   ignored   their   advice    ( insulting   them   in   the   process )  ,    and   did   it   anyway .    but   when   they   saw   that   she   was   in   trouble ,    they   immediately   went   to   help   her ,    and   there   were   no   recriminations   or    " i   told   you   so " s ;    she   was   their   friend ,    and   that   was   all   that   mattered .    then   the   second   transformation   was   good   in   a   different   way    -    after   ursula ['] s   pyrotechnics ,    i   thought   that   triton ['] s   use   of   power   was   nicely   understated .    if   you ['] ve   got   it ,    you   don ['] t   have   to   flaunt   it .
785621036	12307	4.0	this   isn ['] t   one   of   the   big   disney   films ,    but   i   like   it .    the   film   actually   has   some   good   points   to   make   about   relationships   between   parents   and   teenagers ,    with   decent   characterisation   on   both   sides .       a   trivia   note   for   ds9   fans :    the   school   principal   is   voiced   by   the   actor   who   plays   grand   nagus   zek !
785621036	10275	3.0	this   was   surprisingly   good ,    so   i ['] d   recommend   it    -    it   was   funny ,    and   it   didn ['] t   follow   the   usual   formula   of   films   like    " american   pie "  .    one   odd   aspect   to   it   was   that   it   felt   as   if   it   was   over   when   it   was   about   half - way   through ,    and   then   every   10   minutes   or   so   after   that   i   kept   thinking    " ok ,    that   wraps   up   everything   up    .  .  .    oh ,    wait ,    no   it   doesn ['] t "  .    unusual ,    but   it   worked   quite   well .
785621036	3713	3.5	surprisingly   good    -    i ['] m   not   particularly   squeamish ,    but   i   don ['] t   have   much   interest   in    " splatter   films "  .    however ,    the   plot   and   characterisation   was   much   more   important   here ,    and   the   traps   are   quite   inventive .    if   you   liked    " cube "  ,    i ['] d   recommend   this   film   too .
785621036	3239	3.0	i   enjoyed   this    -    i   do   like   disney   films   in   general .
785621036	2554	1.5	i ['] m   glad   that   i   finally   got   round   to   watching   it ,    so   that   i   now   have   a   common   frame   of   reference   with   other   people   who ['] ve   seen   it ,    but   i   don ['] t   think   it ['] s   something   i ['] ll   want   to   watch   over   and   over   again .
785621036	7032	3.0	i   enjoyed   this .    there   were   some   hits   and   misses ,    but   overall   it   was   fun .     " guacamoley !  "
785621036	11638	3.5	i   liked   this   film ,    although   i   did   have   a   minor   dispute   with   a   friend   of   mine   when   it   first   came   out ;    i   think   that   it   counts   as   science - fiction    ( since   it   involves   alternate   realities )  ,    whereas   he   disagreed .    on   the   other   hand ,    i   like   romantic   comedies   too ,    so   it   doesn ['] t   bother   me   if   it   has   that   tag .       mind   you ,    there   is   a   separate   question   of   whether   it   can   be   classed   as   a   comedy ,    since   it   has   various   unhappy   bits   in   it .    i ['] d   go   with   the    " romantic "    description ,    and   there   were   comic   moments   to   it ,    but   it   wasn ['] t   a   comedy   as   such .    at   the   risk   of   sounding   like   a   literary   pseud ,    perhaps   this   film   transcends   genre ?
785621036	7989	5.0	i   enjoyed   this   film    -    it   has   a   good   story ,    strong   characters ,    and   catchy   songs .    it   also   benefitted   from   being   remastered   for   the   imax   release .       i   felt   that   the   film   gave   a   very   mature   view   of   relationships ,    particularly   for   disney .    whereas   other   films   have   focussed   on   one   key   moment   to   base   a   marriage   on ,    e . g .    snow   white   being   kissed   by   the   prince ,    this   story   was   much   more   connected   to   the   personalities   of   the   people   involved .    early   on ,    gaston   tells   belle   that   all   her   dreams   will   come   true ,    and   she   asks   him   what   he   knows   of   her   dreams .
785621036	14618	4.0	an   excellent   film ,    which   could   be   counted   as   science - fiction    ( the   novel    " captive   universe "    has   a   similar   premise )  .    it   has   some   funny   and   touching   scenes ,    while   raising   some   interesting   questions ;    ultimately ,    i ['] d   say   that   it ['] s   an   optimistic   film .
785621036	361	2.5	the   story   dragged   a   bit ,    but   i   was   humming   the   tunes   the   following   day .
785621036	4972	3.0	it ['] s   not   going   to   be   a   genre   classic ,    but   it   was   fun .    if   i   had   to   describe   it   in   one   word ,    i ['] d   say    " macgyver "  .

12848633	10451	4.5	it   is   my   belief   that   the   art   of   directing   has   taken   a   plunge   over   recent   years .    compare   this   to   anything   that   came   out   recently .    you   can ['] t .    know   why ?    because   no - one   nowadays   puts   that   feel   into   their   films .    it ['] s   nothing   you   can   put   your   finger   on ,    but   i   guarantee   that   any   film   nowadays   about   rape ,    murder   and   futuristic   gang   fascism   would   be ,    rather   than   a   classic ,    a   steaming   pile   of   shit .    when   kubrick   takes   a   fairly   simple   story    -    like   this   or   stephen   king ['] s   the   shining    -    he   weaves   something   really   spectacular   into   it .    we   all   know   what   happens   when   he   tackles   something   complex   like   2001 .
12848633	11663	3.0	not   bad .
12848633	2617	1.5	rubbish   film ,    slightly   creepy .
12848633	4384	3.5	preferred   this   to   the   original   except   for   the   baby   zombie   bit .    that   was   just   crap .    i   liked   the   start ,    where   the   crisis   is   all   around   but   unnoticed .    cos   that ['] s   how   it   would   happen .
12848633	6450	5.0	i   can ['] t   really   say   much   apart   from   watch   it ;    you ['] ll   understand .
12848633	12890	3.0	there   you   have   it ,    religion   is   freaky   and   damaging    :  )
12848633	4753	3.0	pretty   good ,    and   well   filmed ,    though   gory   not   scary .
12848633	10835	3.5	pretty   cool .    not   sure   which   came   first ;    this   or   the   exorcist ,    but   there   was   definitely   some   borrowing   going   on .  .
12848633	3195	4.0	i   wouldn ['] t   go   as   far   as   to   say   this   is   the   best   war   film   ever   made    -    that   position   has   to   fall   to   apocalypse   now    -    but   saving   private   ryan   is   still   unbelievably   good .    never   falling   into   the   trap   of   glorifying   war ,    the   bullets ,    the   mud   and   the   visceral   emotions   feel   real .    pun :    one   to   watch .
12848633	16169	3.0	not   awful ,    and   not   totally   devoid   of   frights ,    but   most   of   the   attention   seems   to   have   gone   on   special   effects   rather   than   a   good   script   and   characterisation .
12848633	3917	4.0	don ['] t   have   much   to   say   apart   from   that   this   film   radiates   life ,    and   you   should   watch   it .
12848633	10004	3.5	decidedly   anime ,    the   ninja   scroll   has   it   all    -    weird   ass   demons    ( including   a   blind   samurai    -    zatoichi   anyone ?  )  ,    a   revenge   subplot ,    a   government   conspiracy ,    death ,    disease ,    sex ,    katanas ,    people   jumping   too   high ,    a   reluctant   hero ,    a   femme   fatale ,    a   dodgy   old   man .  .  .    and   some   pretty   sketchy   themes .    and   blood .    lots   of   blood   xd
12848633	6408	4.0	an   absolute   classic ,    and   definitely   one   of   my   favourite   comedies .    this   and   patch   adams   are   robin   williams [']    best   roles ,    in   my   opinion .
12848633	6833	0.5	i   have   given   this   half   a   star   for   one   reason   and   one   reason   only :    flixster   will   not   allow   me   to   give   it   less .    if   they   did ,    this   film   would   get    - 5   out   of    - 5 .    the   script   is   so   pathetic   it   probably   wouldn ['] t   burn   properly .    sandler   is   so   infuriating   he   could   induce   me   to   self   harm .    i   saw   this   on   a   coach   journey   on   my   way   to   germany .    i   had   my   fingers   my   fucking   ears ,    it ['] s   so   bad .    i   mean ,    sandler   at   the   best   of   times   is   just   an   idiot   slapstick   who   needs   a   damnsight   more   than   slapping   with   something   bigger ,    heavier   and   sharper   than   your   average   stick .    at   his   worst    -    this   film    -    he   makes   me   want   to   die .
12848633	12034	4.5	it ['] s   a   classic ,    what   can   i   say ?    the   art   of   horror   has   been   lost   in   most   circles   nowadays ,    and   i   think   contemporary   directors   could   learn   a   lot   from   really   studying   this   film .    it   doesn ['] t   need   to   rely   on   copious   cgi .    the   shocks   are   effortless    -    those   creepy   girls .  .    man   i   still   jumped   even   when   i   knew   exactly   what   was   coming .    very   well   paced   film   as   well .    it   seeps   into   you .
12848633	17181	1.0	not   up   to   standard   at   all .    i ['] m   sorry   but   this   was   not   a   horror   movie :    it   was   just   an   action   movie   exploiting   an   enemy   you   can   happily   slaughter   without   it   being   in   the   slightest   bit   un - pc .    the   zombies   did   not   behave   like   zombies .    this   pissed   me   off .    ok ,    if   they   were    ['] virus [']    zombies   a   la   28   days   later   then   fair   enough ,    i   could   believe   that   they   think .    but   these   zombies   are   dead .    they   cannot   think ,    they   cannot   communicate   and   they   cannot   form   plans .    they   aren ['] t   looking   for   somewhere   to   go ,    they ['] re   looking   to   feast   on   human   flesh .    pisses   me   off :    romero   isn ['] t   even   following   the   rules   that   he   himself   created .    apart   from   that ,    the   human   civilisation   was   complete   whack .    where   are   they   getting   all   these   bullets   from ?    where   do   they   get   all   the   fuel   to   drive   that   gas - guzzler   of   a   truck ?    the   whole   normal   life   thing   was   completely   unbelievable .    the   characterisation   was   bad :    the   film   makers   stereotyped   the   latino   character   to   be   a   violent ,    bad   tempered   cocky   arsehole ,    while   guess   what ?    the   white ,    blonde ,    anglo   saxon   characters   were   the   goodies .    oh   yeah ,    and   i   almost   forgot   to   mention ,    this   film   was   not   in   the   slightest   bit   scary .    no   horror .    28   days   later   owns   this   any   day .
12848633	17293	2.5	a   disgrace   to   the   first   film .    not   totally   devoid   of   creepiness ,    but   a   million   times   less   scary   than   the   ring .
12848633	6287	2.5	not   my   thing ,    though   my   ex   forced   me   to   watch   it   and   it ['] s   not   really   that   bad .
12848633	6545	1.0	i   don ['] t   see   what   the   fuss   is   about .    there   is   no   tension   in   this   film ,    and   no   drama .    the   acting   is   hollow ,    and   where   the   departed   makes   each   situation   utterly   slick ,    infernal   affairs   breezes   through   as   if   nothing   is   going   on .    where   dicaprio ['] s   character   in   the   departed   is   obviously   about   to   lose   it   through   most   of   the   movie ,    the   same   character   in   this   one   coldly   states    " i ['] m   going   insane .  "    it ['] s   a   typical   case   of   show ,    don ['] t   tell ,    so   thank   fuck   for   martin   scorsese .
12848633	9882	4.0	definitely   a   favourite ,    this   film   is   both   sleek ,    slick   and   ferking   hillarious .
12848633	14531	3.5	again ,    it ['] s   basically   a   rehash   of   1984   but   i   am   not   complaining .    i   love   the   idea   of   the   gun   toting   clerics ,    and   yeah   like   brazil   it ['] s   pretty   touching   too .
12848633	15366	4.5	normally   i   don ['] t   go   for   films   that   make   a   pointg   of   being   gory .    i   never   even   bothered   with   saw .    i   don ['] t   find   them   scary ,    just   sad .  .    but   there   is   something   about   this   film .    apart   from   the   seat   arm   splitting   suspense   and   the   cabin   fever   pace ,    it ['] s   actually   got   some   creepy   moments .    and   some   of   the   most   imaginative   aliens   ever .    plus ,    this   film   would   not   work   if   it   was   made   today   because   these   sort   of   effects   are   arguably   done   best   in   stop   motion .    feels   more   realistic .    well   good .
12848633	5991	3.5	excellent   film ,    and   one   of   the   most   stylish   and   original   movies   of   our   time .
12848633	3925	3.5	this   is   good .    but   unfortunately   it ['] s   not   a   work   of   art   like   the   first   film .    still ,    hard   to   argue   with   the   soundtrack    : p   and   i   gotta   say ,    the   burly   brawl   had   me   clapping   in   the   cinema .    bear   in   mind   i   am   a   huge   fan   of   the   first   film .
12848633	8328	3.5	again ,    hillarious   but   not   scary .    i   also   liked   the   lack   of   americans .
12848633	1975	2.5	pretty   crap   really .
12848633	8333	4.0	i   liked   this   almost   as   much   as   ju - on ,    the   japanese   original   version .    it   was   directed   by   the   same   guy   and   seems   to   have   some   of   the   same   cast ,    i   think ,    and   certain   bits   of   the   story   are   better   done ,    but   it   doesn ['] t   have   the   tv   scene ,    which   is   brilliant .    kik - kk - k - kikk - kk - kkik .  .  .
12848633	8079	3.0	ok   film ,    shame   it   isn ['] t   at   all   scary .
12848633	5154	3.5	had   quite   a   fun   night   watching   this   then   stigmata   for   the   first   time .    modern   and   therefore   not   scary ,    but   i   like   it ,    and   it   has   some   good   touches ,    like   the   whole   cancer   thing .    he   can   visit   hell   when   he   wants   and   he ['] s   gonna   die   soon .    there ['] s   a   real    ['] days   are   numbered [']    feel
12848633	14755	4.5	majorly   good   just   for   the   way   it   was   filmed .    i   didn ['] t   find   it   scary ,    but   as   a   film   it   still   merits   4 . 5   stars .
12848633	468	4.0	again ,    not   as   good   as   number   1   but   a   damn   good   film   anyway .    and   i   like   the   apus .    i   want   one .    still ,    the   end   scene   is   a   bit   shite    (  & quot ; i   believed .  .  .  & quot ;  )    and   what   happened   to   the   music ?  ?    also ,    the   kid   annoys   me .    but   yeah ,    better   graphics   that   number   2   and   it   ties   the   story   up   well ,    with   plenty   to   guess   about   still .    is   the    ['] real [']    world   actually   the   real   world   or   is   it   another   layer   of   deception ?    if   this   isn ['] t   the   case   how   come   neo   can   bend   the   rules   of   the   real   world ?    huh ?    huh ?
12848633	10627	3.0	ahhh   it   made   me   laugh .
12848633	1012	2.0	nah ,    not   scary ,    sorry .
12848633	15473	3.5	marginally   less   funny   than   the   first ,    but   still   an   absolute   corker .    the   fight   scene   in   the   enemy   camp ,    especially .    with   the   chicken   bit .    ahhh   class .
12848633	2376	3.5	not   as   good   as   the   first   two ,    but   for   some   reason   i   actually   found   this   a   little   scary   in   places   so   it   keeps   the   3 . 5   score .
12848633	8585	3.5	ahhh   i ['] ve   long   loved   this   movie .    i   really   enjoy   the   balance   it   creates   between   a   more   or   less   present - day   situation   and   all   out   anarchy .    you   see   society   just   about   tipping   over   the   edge   here    -    the   cops   would   be   pretty   powerless   against   these   clockwork   orange   types   on   wheels   if   it   wasn ['] t   for   max ,    a   solitary ,    harsh   enforcer   who   is   heading   for   the   darkness   himself .    i   enjoy   the   character   development   you   get   over   the   trillogy ,    not   just   in   max   but   in   the   world   itself .
12848633	7331	2.5	not   good ,    not   scary ,    and   my   whole   family   saw   the   twist   coming   about   20   minutes   beforehand   but   johnny   depp   is   really   good   in   it   anyway   so   not   a   total   failure   of   a   film .
12848633	17149	2.5	creepy   in   its   own   way ,    but   not   well   made .
12848633	4829	4.0	hillarious   film   that   suddenly   gets   sad   at   the   end .    not   scary   though .
12848633	4831	3.5	haha   what   a   laff    -    rednecks   vs   giant   killer   worms    : d   not   in   the   least   bit   scary ,    but   really   funny   though .
12848633	2395	3.5	hillarious ,    of   course    : d
12848633	9298	3.5	pretty   funny .
12848633	12471	4.0	brilliant   film ,    surprisingly .    eminem   is   perfect   for   the   role ,    turns   out   to   be   quite   a   good   actor   and   conveys   stage   fright   very   well .    all   his   rhymes   in   the   film   were   written   on   set   by   him   moments   before   going   on ,    and   for   the   rap   battle   scenes   he   actually   freestyled   against   actual   detroit   rappers ,    who   had   signed   on   as   extras ,    which   brings   an   increadible   freshness   and   gritty   realism   to   the   movie .
12848633	985	1.0	nope ,    rubbish ,    i ['] m   sorry .    and   i   can ['] t   remember   if   it ['] s   in   this   one   or   the   mummy   returns   but   in   those   days   machine   guns   did   not   have   that   rate   of   fire .
12848633	12293	4.5	one   of   those   classics   you   either   like ,    or   are   an   idiot .
12848633	14482	4.0	oh   man   i   love   it !  !    this   film   has   a   weird   pace ,    and   it   just   feels   a   lot   more   well   made   than   more   recent   hollywood .    and   i   won ['] t   spoil   it   but   there ['] s   a   good   twist    :  )
12848633	2528	3.0	this   isn ['] t   scary .    i   was   pissing   myself   rather   than   shitting   myself .    still   good   though    : d
12848633	10662	4.5	oooooo   i ['] ve   yet   to   see   a   better   anime !  !    it ['] s   a   very   japanese   film    -    the   story   is   so   hard   to   follow   it   makes   the   matrix   look   simple .    really   it   does .    in   fact ,    the   matrix   is   simple .    yeh .    and   bloody   hell ,    the   music !  !    ohhhh   the   music !  !    i   love   the   sountrack   of   this   movie .
12848633	5939	1.0	it ['] s   shite ,    get   over   it .
12848633	3385	4.5	brilliant   film .    lots   of   suspense ,    although   when   the   soldiers   turn   up   it ['] s   less   scary .    i   dunno ,    as   soon   as   guns   are   introduced   the   fear   leaves   cos   you   can   always   shoot   the   zombies .    but   still ,    wow   what   a   film .
12848633	8379	3.5	a   good   story ,    good   action ,    good   acting .  .  .    but   nothing   truly   classic ,    just   very   good .
12848633	10886	4.0	i ['] ve   loved   this   movie   for   years .    great   concept ,    some   pretty   stunning   imagery ,    and   a   wicked   boat .    though   for   some   reason   it   says   down   there   that   it   was   badly   received .    i   don ['] t   understand   that ,    but   i   guess   it   makes   sense :    the   film   makes   ideological   enemies   of   the   oil   industry ,    the   tobacco   industry   and   the   anti - global   warming   lobbyists .    wouldn ['] t   have   been   hard   for   them   to   sow   some   shit   about   it   pre - release .
12848633	5515	4.0	i ['] d   actually   forgotten   how   much   i   loved   this   film .    hillarious   from   start   to   finish    : d
12848633	6223	3.5	i   can ['] t   remember   a   lot   about   this   film   except   that   i   liked   it    : s
12848633	2430	4.0	classic ,    innit .    not   scary ,    but   still   very   innovative .
12848633	11771	2.0	nah ,    sorry   it   was   pretty   crap .
12848633	4306	4.0	this   has   its   creepy   moments ,    but   really   i ['] ve   given   it   4   stars   for   being   well   made ,    and   for   the   excellent   twist   at   the   end .

235039916	3463	4.0	there   isn ['] t   even   10   things   i   hate   about   this   movie .    great   movie .
235039916	14691	3.0	ok   but   i   couldn ['] t   really   get   into   it .
235039916	2985	1.5	maybe   two   or   three   scenes   worth   watching .
235039916	3938	1.5	not   really   my   taste   in   movies .    i   only   enjoyed   it   the   first   time .
235039916	14103	3.5	at   first   i   wasn ['] t   interested   but   after   seeing   it   i   enjoyed   it .
235039916	15063	1.0	haven ['] t   really   seen   it   only   bits   and   pieces   of   it .
235039916	7521	4.0	i ['] m   a   horror   movie   buff   and   loved   the   rip   offs .
235039916	10928	2.5	it   was   ok .
235039916	17479	0.5	i ['] m   a   horror   movie   buff   so   this   disappointed   me .
235039916	10583	3.5	pretty   good   and   worth   watching   a   few   times .
235039916	3962	3.5	i ['] m   not   big   on   kid   movies   but   this   one   was   ok .
235039916	2463	3.5	again   i ['] m   not   big   on   kid   movies   but   it ['] s   worth   watching .
235039916	7664	3.0	good   movie   with   great   fight   scenes .
235039916	17324	2.5	i   wouldn ['] t   mind   watching   this   all   the   way   through .
235039916	11337	5.0	the   only   good   reason   to   watch   this   movie   is   the   one   scene   with   shannon   elizabeth .
235039916	15393	2.5	not   one   of   adam   sandlers   better   films .    i   guess   everyone   makes   a   just   ok   movie   from   time   to   time .
235039916	4996	3.5	i   had   to   cry   at   the   end   when   they   smashed   eleanor .    love   that   car .
235039916	12471	3.5	eminem   makes   a   very   convincing   character   in   this .    i   guess   art   imitates   real   life   or   vice   versa .
235039916	2874	0.5	like   i   said   i   can ['] t   stand   will   ferrell .    i   think   he   is   too   loud   and   over - acts .
235039916	1962	3.5	drew   barrymore   plays   the   part   extremely   well .    again   some   of   adam   sandlers   best   work .
235039916	329	3.5	absolutely   freakin   hilarious .
235039916	6844	3.5	fast   cars ,    paul   walker   and   vin   diesel .    great   movie .
235039916	11077	2.5	good   movie   but   only   if   you   like   ben   stiller .

235039916	9591	4.0	good   movie .    worth   owning   which   is   why   i   do   own   it .
235039916	16765	3.5	has   two   of   my   favorite   actors   in   it   and   a   lot   of   violence   with   a   great   plot .
235039916	17088	3.0	not   really   a   fan   of   ben   stiller   but   it ['] s   a   little   funny .
235039916	3713	4.5	absolute   genius .    man   against   instinct .    what   would   you   do   to   survive ?
235039916	5571	2.0	it   was   ok .
235039916	16879	3.0	a   bit   of   a   chick   flick .    i   didn ['] t   like   leo   dicaprio   but   the   sinking   scene   really   did   this   movie   justice .    i   loved   the   special   effects .
235039916	3864	4.5	christian   bale   is   by   far   the   best   batman .    the   other   batman   movies   should   be   locked   up   and   never   shown   again .
235039916	6287	4.0	julia   roberts   is   hot   and   makes   this   movie   great .
235039916	13102	3.5	i ['] ve   seen   this   movie   almost   100   times .
235039916	16377	3.5	i   loved   reading   the   books .
235039916	3860	4.0	a   little   heart   warming   but   some   of   jim   carey ['] s   best   work .
235039916	2095	3.5	hilarious .
235039916	5991	4.0	worth   watching .    it   does   the   dark   comics   justice .
235039916	3579	3.5	pretty   good   but   i   think   the   first   one   is   better .

785152918	9685	4.0	inspiring .
785152918	1305	5.0	one   of   my   favorites .    this   movie   is   very   easy   to   relate   to   and   portrays   the   truth .     [ even   though   13   may   be   extreme ,    15   or   16   seems   a   better   age .  ]    it ['] s   well   acted   out   and   the   actors   did   a   great   job .    it   really   makes   you   think .     & lt ; 3
785152918	11077	3.5	not   as   funny   as   the   first ,    but   still   entertaining .    some   parts   are   so   unnecessary   though .  . like   streisand   as   a   sex   therapist .  .     - cringe -    jokes   were   repeated   and   it   just   didn ['] t   live   up   to   the   first   movie .
785152918	13359	2.5	the   play   is   better ,    but   i ['] ve   always   leaned   that   way .    certain   characters    [ catherine   zeta - jones   and   john   c .    reily ]    are   well   acted   while   others   make   me   want   to   claw   my   ears   out .     [ coughreneecough ]  .    the   music   was   great   and   the   choreography   for   cell   block   tango   was   fantastic .
785152918	15205	2.5	despite   being   a   movie   i ['] ve   had   to   watch   3   times   in   school   already ,    it   was   pretty   decent .    makes   me   worry   we ['] re   all   going   to   die   soon ,    but   still   decent .
785152918	1905	5.0	my   favorite   of   the   three .    added   just   the   right   amount   of   new   characters   to   keep   it   interesting .    the   rum   jokes   got   old   quick ,    but   that ['] s   okay ,    because   it ['] s   johnny .
785152918	3938	4.0	cute ,    i   like   the   jokes   they   had   with   the   shop   names   within   the   town ,    but   it   wasn ['] t   as   good   as   the   first   one .    this   movie   sort   of   dragged   on .
785152918	14103	4.0	this   movie   is   so   romantic   and   sweet .    i   love   the   acting ,    it   really   showed   rachel   mcadams   as   an   actress .
785152918	10928	1.5	not   a   fan   of   jim   carey   but   this   movie   is   ok .

785152918	17479	1.0	lame .    not   scary   at   all .    waste   of   money .
785152918	3962	5.0	dory   is   me ,    in   cartoon   fish   form .    this   movie   is   so   adorable .
785152918	12881	5.0	love   love   love   love .    this   is   such   a   sweet   love   story .    never   fails   to   make   me   cry .    the   music   and   the   visuals   are   amazing .    worth   renting
785152918	2463	3.5	funny .    but   not   that   great .    i   do   admit ,    jack   jack   is   about   the   coolest   baby   in   the   world   though .
785152918	7607	5.0	i   love   this   movie .    the   dancing   is   amazing ,    and   i   just   want   to   hump   on   diego   luga .

677264505	11077	3.0	a   little   weird   but   funny .
677264505	1905	5.0	you   rarely   find   a   movie   that   has   the   perfect   cast .    most   have   some   good   cast   members   but   it   is   rare   to   have   every   single   character   that   appears   be   perfect .    this   cast   is   top   notch .    right   up   there   with   the   lord   of   the   rings .    johnny   is   a   genious   and   orlando   captures   the   escence   of   his   character   flawlessly .
677264505	8989	3.0	really   cool   movie .    the   dance   scenes   are   really   good .

677264505	7521	0.5	this   is   a   really   stupid   movie .
677264505	6235	4.5	shane   west   and   mandy   moore   are   awesome   in   the   movie .    it   is   such   a   good   story   and   unlike   some   sappy   dull   love   stories   there   is   some   action . drama   and   the   ending ,    though   sad ,    is   well   done .
677264505	17479	0.5	horror    =    me   not   liking   it
677264505	13610	3.0	i   like   films   that   are   based   from   comic   books ,    this   one   was   one   of   the   better   ones   too .

677264505	17324	3.0	i   was   dissapointed   with   this   one .    will   smith   is   so   talented   but   this   movie   was   dull   and   predictable .
677264505	2463	4.0	cute   story   and   the   whole   family   things   is   really   cool .
677264505	16879	4.0	touching   story ,    but   my   sister   made   me   watch   it   so   much   i   can   barely   stand   it   anymore ,    good   movie   though .
677264505	6287	5.0	classic .    a   funny   and   interesting   love   story .
677264505	7032	0.5	horrible .    this   movie   is   so   screwed   up   and   completely   disgusting   i   can ['] t   stand   it !
677264505	5239	2.5	not   the   best   i ['] ve   seen   from   adam   sandler   but   it   was   really   funny .
677264505	3860	1.5	i ['] ve   never   been   a   fan   of   god   mocking ,    i ['] m   not   really   religious   but   still ,    it   doesn ['] t   seem   like   an   appropriate   way   to   try   and   make   money .
677264505	758	0.5	i   cannot   stand   this   movie   it   is   slutty ,    over   the   top ,    annoying   and   the   parts   where   suddenly   it   is   the   animal   kingdom   is   strange .    the   comdy   was   not   really   comedy   it   was   more   like   an   attempt   at   being   funny   with   pervertedness   and   sluttiness .
771199515	205	5.0	one   of   my   most   fav   pitt   movies    .  .  .    bloom   plays   a   bit   of   a   sissy   in   this    .  .
771199515	2913	4.0	once   again   depp   is   in   another   good   role .  .  .    it   is   an   enlightning   tale   of   how   peter   pan   came   about .  .    good   show

771199515	4262	4.5	another   depp   fav    .  .  .    creepy   but   his   character   is   cowardly   in   a   way   but   comes   through   when   needed
771199515	6386	4.0	humor   at   one   of   its   highest   with   whoopi   in   this   outstanding   role
771199515	2376	3.0	typical   slasher   movie   but   it   was   ok   and   i   am   glad   they   ended   it   with   just   3
771199515	3290	4.0	again   a   great   classic   film
771199515	4384	3.5	not   bad   for   a   re - make   of   an   older   horror   flick
771199515	3750	5.0	hanks   makes   yet   another   unlikely   character   very   lovable   and   interesting    .  .  .
771199515	7331	5.0	depp   in   one   of   his   most   intriguing   roles .  .  .  .    he   is   mysterious   and   he   keeps   you   at   the   edge   of   your   seat   in   this   movie .  .  .  .    highly   recommend   seeing   this .  .  .    even   if   you   have   never   read   stephen   king   you   will   like   this   adaptation .

788651966	1905	3.5	good   characters ,    some   fun   scenes   but   its   been   a   while   since   i   saw   it   and   it   didn ['] t   leave   a   lasting   impression .

174808986	6531	1.5	i   like   adam   sandler   and   all ,    but   this   movie ['] s   a   piece   of   crap .       its   definitely   not   as   bad   as   that   monstrosity    ['] 50   first   dates [']  ,    but   in   the   end ,    punch   drunk   love   has   a   total   lack   of   entertainment   value .       the   best   thing   about   it   is   the   acting   which   is   quite   good ,    i   loathed   all   the   characters .       sandler   was   just   a   big   pussy   with   an   occasional   outburst    ( best   scenes   in   the   movie )  .       emily   watson   was   cute   as   a   button ,    but   like   i   said   man ,    punch   drunk   love   was   just   totally   boring   and   artsy   crapola .       where ['] s   my   happy   gilmore   dvd ?

836507980	3938	3.5	pretty   funny   movie ,    not   as   good   as   the   first   one ,    they   went   a   little   overboard
836507980	14103	3.0	although   not   as   great   as   i   thought   it   would   be ,    it   was   a   very   touching   ending

836507980	17479	2.0	soooo   not   as   scary   as   the   hype ,    and   more   just   visually   frightening   rather   than   actually    " scary "

836507980	10583	4.0	this   was   just   as   funny   as   it   was   impressive   that   the   kids   were   actually   the   musicians !
836507980	3962	5.0	totally   enchanting   and   hilarious !
836507980	2463	4.0	not   the   best   pixar   film ,    but   still   entertaining .       the   scene   with   the   baby   at   the   end   makes   me   chortle !

836507980	3860	4.5	loved   it    -    the   scene   with   steve   carell   is   one   of   the   funniest   i ['] ve   ever   seen !
836507980	758	3.0	actually   pretty   entertaining ,    as   far   as   pre - rehab   lindsey   lohan   goes
370733854	10392	4.5	fantastic .    goes   on   a   bit   and   basically   is   in   two   halves ,    but   they   go   together   really   well   with   the   second   one   compeltely   dependent   on   the   first .
370733854	10225	4.0	fast   becoming   a   classic .    hadn ['] t   seen   this   in   years   and   then   saw   it   at   the   cinema .    i   was   pleasantly   surprised .    there   is   some   analogy   to   life   in   there .
370733854	2985	3.0	actually   quite   funny   and   it   features   jonothan   richman .
370733854	13073	5.0	the   ultimate   feel   good   movie ?    maybe .    it   certainly   has   cheered   me   up   on   many   occasion .
370733854	6927	3.5	silly   and   lots   of   fun .    a   little   steriotyped   in   certain   ways ,    but   the   big   car   chase   certainly   makes   up   for   all   of   it ['] s   short   comings .
370733854	12071	3.5	fun   slacker   movie .    almost   makes   the   mall   a   bearable   place   to   hang   out .
370733854	7701	3.0	probably   the   best   of   the   mad   max   movies .
370733854	11658	4.5	romantic   thriller   which   maintains   tension   by   the   truth   only   becoming   slowly   revealed .    don ['] t   we   all   wish   some   break   up   was   all   a   big   misunde3rstanding   and   we   could   go   back   to   a   nice   place   from   the   past   again ?
370733854	7767	4.0	fantastic .    i ['] m   going   to   have   to   see   this   on   the   big   screen .    well   written   with   lots   of   interesting   characters .    cool   soundtrack   too .

370733854	1176	3.5	good   performances   from   a   young   cast .    less   of   a   jumpy   horror   than   a   stylish   one   with   a   well   told   story .    set   during   the   spanish   civil   war ,    a   time   when   malevolent   forces   were   making   a   sinister   impression   on   the   country .
370733854	6029	5.0	the   person   we   all   wish   we   could   were .    a   young ,    innocent ,    beautiful ,    quirky ,    loveable ,    do - gooding   french   girl .    well ,    maybe   not   the   french   bit .  .  .
370733854	758	3.5	well   written .    are   american   high   schools   really   like   this ?    they   are   always   protrayed   as   such   on   tv   and   film .
370733854	329	3.5	a   kevin   smith   movie   that   doesn ['] t   go   on   about   star   wars   or   comics   or   something .    nicely   done   quirky   send   up   of   christianity .
370733854	4506	3.5	pretty   good .    avoids   being   over   dramatic   and   is   nice   and   light .
370733854	5401	3.0	amusing   and   silly   movie .    i   liked   the   pirate   fella .
370733854	3917	4.0	slacker   returns   home ,    hangs   out   and   attmepts   to   achieve   enlightenment .    sounds   like   a   plan   to   me .

370733854	1744	2.0	silly   and   obvious ,    but   eddie   murphy   is   a   reasonably   funny   fella .
370733854	1865	4.0	takes   an   interesting   idea   and   then   goes   all   funky    ( which   is   probably   a   good   thing   as   you   probably   couldn ['] t   make   a   decent   film   that   investigates   the   philosophical   elements )  .    good .
370733854	12244	2.0	i   can ['] t   help   but   feel   that   this   isn ['] t   the   hum - drum   life ,    but   a   hollywood - ised   version   of   it .
370733854	8317	4.0	romantic   comedies   aren ['] t   usually   my   thing ,    but   this   is   funny ,    whitty   and   off   the   wall .    plus   it   has   a   really   cool   soundtrack .
370733854	13636	3.5	sometimes   silly   and   sometimes   quite   accurate .
370733854	6886	3.5	what   do   cinefiles   do   when   the   cinema   gets   shut   down   by   the   government ?    wander   around   the   house   naked   and   have   sex   is   what .
633723021	4402	3.0	say .  .  .    this   wasn ['] t   supposed   to   make   me   laugh ,    now ,    was   it ?    i   saw   it   when   i   was   little   and   i   do   not   seem   to   remember   the   laughing   part .    i   just   remember   my   being   afraid   of   falling   asleep .     ( man .  .  .    i   was   such   a   wuss   back   then .  )    so .  .  .    i   guess   i   should   take   into   consideration   that   this   movie   is   kinda   old   and   that   they   didn ['] t   have   the   means   to   make   it   any   better   than   it   actually   is .    at   least   in   terms   of   especial   fx .    but   what   about   the   acting ?    did   they   really   need   to   rely   on   technology   in   order   to   achieve   good   performances ?    i   think   not .    sorry ,    but   the   kids   didn ['] t   manage   to   convince   me   as   scared   people   at   all .    especially   that   nancy   kid .    yeah ,    you   could   say   she ['] s   a   very   brave   girl   and   that   she   dealt   with   the   brutal   deaths   the   best   way   that   she   could .    but   it   would   still   seem   like   a   pretty   far - fectched   kind   of   acting   to   me .    and   the   same   goes   for   her   mother .  .  .    who   on   earth   did   the   casting   for   this   movie ,    anyway ?    ah ,    forget   it .  .  .    i   don ['] t   really   wanna   know .    i   guess   i ['] m   just   a   little   frustrated   here .    i   was   hoping   to   get   scared   while   watching   freddy ,    but   instead   all   he   did   was   make   me   laugh .    and   it ['] s   not   that   i   don ['] t   enjoy   laughing .    most   of   the   times   i   do .    i   just   don ['] t   like   it   to   happen   whenever   i ['] m   watching   a   horror   film .    still ,    the   concept   here   is   a   very   good   one .    the   idea   that   a   killer   is   able   to   reach   you   in   your   dreams   is   a   somewhat   freaky   one   and   should   thus   receive   the   deserved   credits .    i   only   think   it   should   have   been   displayed   differently .    this   way ,    the   only   people   who   will   be   scared   are   underage   ones .    pity !
633723021	10231	3.5	i   went   to   see   this   movie   at   the   theater   back   when   it   was   released ,    just   because   of   the   daggers   scene .    it   was   hilarious !    there   are   definitely   some   pretty   good   humorous   scenes   here .    i   actually   lmfao   several   times   while   watching   it .    great   comical   performances !    there ['] s   something   about   the   characters [']    facial   expressions   that   just   cracks   me   up .    the   way   i   see   it ,    the   only   downside   of   this   film   are   the   frigging   endless   kung   fu   fighting   scenes .    but   even   those   got   me   laughing   from   time   to   time .
633723021	143	5.0	this   is   what   i   call   an    " is   it   or   is   it   not "    movie .    don ['] t   you   just   love   it   when   a   film   has   the   hability   to   surprise   you ?    it ['] s   so   refreshing   when   i   can ['] t   figure   out   what   the   ending   is   going   to   be   like .    but   the   game   goes   way   ahead   of   that   since ,    not   only   it   got   me   surprised   at   the   end ,    but   also   during   the   entire   movie .    the   twists   are   just   brilliant !    they   play   with   your   mind ,    trick   you ,    and   lead   your   thoughts   to   where   they   want   them   to   go .    at   a   certain   point ,    you   just   can ['] t   be   sure   of   anything   anymore    -    hence   the    " is   it   or   is   it   not "    part .

( awaiting   reply .  .  .    sitting   on   my   ass .    or   else   i ['] ll   get   tired   of   waiting .  )       damn !    i   must   take   a   bow .    the   japanese   movie   people   have   finally   made   it .    and   i   say   it   was   about   time   they   did .       this   one   starts   off   as   what   it   seems   to   be   an   ordinary   movie   about   relationships   and   such   mundane   issues .    and   if   you   still   don ['] t   know   what   this   story   is   about   when   you   start   watching   it    ( or ,    at   least ,    haven ['] t   yet   seen   one   of   your   twisted   friends   saying   great   things   about   it   around   here )  ,    you   might   actually   think   it   doesn ['] t   get   any   better   than   that .    well .  .  .    as   it   turns   out .  .  .    you   couldn ['] t   be   more   wrong .    all   you   really   have   to   do   is   wait   until   the   story   starts   to   unfold .    from   that   moment   on ,    it   gets   better   and   better   by   the   minute .    and   although   the   movie   pace   is   somewhat   slow   most   of   the   time    ( especially   in   the   beginning )  ,    i ['] m   quite   happy   to   say   it   doesn ['] t   ruin   the   enjoyment   of   watching   it .    in   this   particular   case ,    i   actually   think   it   is   a   suitable   pace .    or   else ,    i   would   have   been   bored   at   some   point .    which   wasn ['] t   the   case .    so .  .  .    i ['] ve   come   to   a   conclusion .  .  .    i      guess   the   asian   fellows   should   definitely   leave   the   supernatural   horror   aside    ( which ,    in   my   opinion ,    shouldn ['] t   even   be   labelled   as   horror ,    considering   that   it   isn ['] t   horrifying   at   all )    and   just   stick   to   a   more   earthly   kind   of   horror .    like ,    say .  .  .    oh ,    i   don ['] t   know .  .  .    mad   screwed   up   female   human   specimens   with   long   sharp   needles   as   their   friends .    just   an   idea ,    though .
633723021	3333	4.5	it ['] s   utterly   sad   the   way   this   movie   is   so   underrated !    i   had   to   watch   it   again   before   i   could   review   it ,    because   i   think   it ['] s   definitely   the   high   point   of   shyamalan ['] s   career ,    and   i   wouldn ['] t   wanna   babble   about   it   without   having   a   vivid   memory   of   it   first .  .  .    the   screenplay   is   just   amazing !    i   think   it   deals   with   some   real   important   aspects   of   the   way   people   lead   their   lifes   and   also   the   way   they   are   affected   by   the   choices   they   make    ( and   vice   versa )  .    the   human   condition   is   in   fact   very   well   captured   in   this   movie .    you   will   be   presented   with   a   splendid   array   of   emotions   which   range   from   the   darkest   to   the   noblest   ones   of   humankind .    i   believe   there ['] s   a   lesson   to   be   learned   in   this   film .    and ,    in   my   opinion ,    the   fact   that   you ['] ll   ejoy   it   or   not   will   depend   on   how   well   you   understand   that   particular   lesson .    and   it   has   nothing   to   do   with   wits .    it ['] s   all   about   life   experiences   and   common   sense .  .  .    so ,    besides   the   wonderful   screenplay ,    you   also   get   the   bonus   of   some   astounding   performances .    the   acting   is   so   good   that   you   almost   feel   like   you   are   really   taking   part   in   the   events   of   that   village .     ( oh ,    and   i   take   my   hat   off   to   brody .    his   performance   is   just   flawless .  )  .  .  .    summing   it   up :    one   of   the   most   well   achieved   movies   i ['] ve   ever   seen !    great   plot ,    great   screenplay ,    great   performances ,    and   the   ability   to   touch   you   without   the   lameness   factor .
633723021	13610	3.0	this   one   was   a   little   too    " like   every   other   movie "    to   me .    it   was   interesting   to   see   how   he   got   to   become   the   super   hero ,    but   after   that   same   old   same   old .    i   don ['] t   think   there ['] s   anything    -    besides   what   i   have   already   said    -    worthy   of   being   mentioned   about   this   one .    and   hence ,    i   have   nothing   further   to   declare .

633723021	3626	3.0	i   think   i   must   have   held   my   hopes   too   high   for   this   movie .    i   was   expecting   a   lot   more   than   what   i   was   presented   with .    and   i   have   a   tiny   confession   to   make :    i   actually   yawned   a   little   bit   throughout   some   scenes .    don ['] t   get   me   wrong .    it   really   deserves   at   least   a   peek   at   it ,    because   it ['] s   not   such   a   bad   movie   in   terms   of   the   screenplay .    and   the   performances   definitely   make   it   worthwhile   watching .    the   thing   is   that   i   got   bored   sometimes .    some   of   the   scenes   just   seem   to   drag   forever   and   the   whole   movie   pace   is   a   bit   too   slow   for   my   taste .    to   tell   you   the   truth ,    i ['] ve   found   the   first   scene    -    even   before   the   opening   credits    -    to   be   the   most   interesting   and   appealing   of   them   all .    now ,    that ['] s   when   you   get   the   quick   pace   and   the   amusing   lines .    if   only   the   rest   of   the   film   had   been   like   that ,    i   think   i   would   probably   consider   putting   it   somewhere   amongst   my   favorite   movies .    anyway ,    maybe   your   opinion   will   differ   from   mine .    and   despite   the   occasional   yawning ,    i   think   it ['] s   worth   the   time   you ['] ll   spend   watching   it .
633723021	16286	3.5	i   have   to   say   that ,    while   watching   this   movie ,    i   almost   felt   tempted   to   drag   my   lazy   ass   out   of   bed   and   literally   bow   down   to   dr .    lecter ['] s   bright   sarcastic   remarks .    there ['] s   no   possible   way   you   won ['] t   find   yourself   to   be   dazzled   by   this   unique   character .    ok ,    so   he   is   sort   of   into   the   cannibalism   thing .    so   what ?    if   will   graham   was   still   drawn   by   him   after   he   tried   to   have   him   for   dinner ,    who   are   we   to   judge   the   doctor ['] s   deeds ?  .  .  .    and   who   better   than   hopkins   to   portray   those   deeds   in   the   most   gracious   way ?    that   gentleman ['] s   acting   is   definitely   flawless .    you   can   really   see   the   madness   in   his   eyes   throughout   the   entire   movie .    also   norton   with   a   great   performance ,    as   well   as   the   rest   of   the   cast .    and   yet ,    despite   all   the   compliments ,    i ['] ve   only   found   it   to   be   a   3   1 / 2   stars   movie .  .  .    well ,    you   can   blame   it   on   the   blond   haired   norton .  .  .    just   kidding .    actually ,    the   rest   of   the   stars   are   missing   because   it ['] s   too   much   of   a   cop   movie   for   my   taste .    nevertheless ,    i   think   the   plot   is   clever   enough   to   make   it   worthwhile .
633723021	13255	4.0	this   is   life .    a   great   display   of   real   life .    so   vivid   that   i   sometimes   felt   like   screaming   and   eventually   kicking   some   of   the   characters   right   in   the   ass .    and   this   is   exactly   what   i   most   liked   about   this   movie .    the   fact   that   it   was   capable   of   bringing   out   all   sorts   of   emotions   within   me   while   i   was   watching   it .    most   of   the   time ,    i   tend   to   really   appreciate   a   movie   that   is   capable   of   remaining   truthful   to   reality .    and   that   was   exactly   what   happened   here .    the   plot   is   presented   in   such   a   realistic   manner   that   you   won ['] t   be   able   to   become   indifferent   to   it .    every   situation   will   somehow   cause   you   to   feel      some   kind   of   emotion   towards   what   is   being   displayed ,    and   you   will   actually   feel   like   you   are   watching   it   live   and   not   on   your   tv   set .    real   life   characters   such   as   these   are   very   hard   to   find   when   it   comes   to   movies   nowadays .    and ,    to   me ,    that ['] s   what   makes   this   movie   so   special .    it   portrays   people   as   they   really   are   and   not   as   either   plain   good   or   plain   evil .    because   people   aren ['] t   like   that   at   all .    most   films   tend   to   fail   in   that   specific   area ,    in   that   they   often   present   the   clichéd   segregation   between    ['] the   good   guy [']    and   the    ['] bad   guy [']  .    in   crash ,    all   the   characters   are   both   the   good   and   the   bad   guy   at   the   same   time .    they   really   are   like   you   and   me ,    and   everybody   else   around .    and   when   it   comes   to   heroes .  .  .    i   guess   you   can   say   there   are   a   few   heroes   in   this   movie .    real   life   ones ,    i   mean .    the   kind   of   heroes   that   you   would   find   just   around   the   corner   on   any   given   day .    so ,    yes ,    this   movie   is   indeed   as   realistic   as   it   can   be   and ,    gladly ,    not   far   fetched   in   any   way .    plus ,    the   screenplay   is   very   good   and   also   very   intense   emotionwise .       how   could   one   possibly   not   like   it ,    then ?  .  .  .       don ['] t   answer .

633723021	11152	4.5	just   watched   it   for   the   second   time .    a   few   years   gone   by   since   the   first   time   i ['] ve   seen   it ,    and   i   realize   now    -    with   a   different   state   of   mind   and   a   few   more   wrinkles   than   before    -    that   it   really   puts   things   into   perpective .  .  .    how   do   you   handle   everything   that   sorrounds   you   while   you ['] re   growing   up ?    how   do   those   things   affect   you   and   shape   you   throughout   your   entire   life ?    what ['] s   the   meaning   you   make   of   your   environment   and   to   what   extent   is   that   meaning   really   your   own ?    how   can   you   tell   when   you ['] ve   become   a   puppet   of   other ['] s   ideologies   instead   of   the   ones   you   really   believe   in ?  .  .  .    many   questions   start   popping   up   while   you ['] re   watching   this   movie .    cruel   reality   is   thrown   right   at   your   face   and   all   you   can   do   to   shut   your    & quot ; big   mouth & quot ;    mind   and   stop   it   from   questioning   is   either   close   your   eyes   and   cover   your   ears ,    or   simply   turn   off   the   tv .    otherwise ,    you   have   no   choice   but   to   face   the   fact   that   social   influence   can   definitely   be   a   total   pain   in   the   ass    ( literally   speaking ,    in   this   specific   case )  .    as   for   the   peformances ,    i ['] m   glad   to   say   they   all   played   their   parts   very   well   and   in   a   realistic   manner .    nevertheless ,    and   as   usual ,    norton ['] s   acting   was   there   to   shade   everyone   else   on   the   set .    his   performance   is   almost   spotless   in   this   movie   and   kills   every   possibility   for   others   to   shine   brighter   than   he   does .    there   are   certain   scenes   where   the   nazi   derek   vinyard   really   can   make   the   hairs   on   the   back   of   your   neck   stand   up .    and   this   is   how   real   and   convincing   he   was   as   a    & quot ; junior   kkk & quot ;    of   modern   times .       lets   see ,    now .  .  .    if   you ['] re   planning   on   seeing   this   movie ,    i   say   you   couldn ['] t   make   a   better   choice .    but ,    if   you ['] re   not .  .  .    then ,    i ['] m   gonna   have   to   ask   you   to   go   outside ,    lie   down   on   the   street   next   to   the   side   walk ,    and   put   your   mouth   on   the   curb .  .  .    that ['] s   it !    now   say   good   night .
633723021	11771	3.0	this   seemed   a   lot   better   before   having   read   the   book .    but   now   that   i ['] ve   read   it ,    i   just   can ['] t   bring   myself   to   enjoy   it   as   much   as   i   did   back   when   it   was   released .    saw   it   again   just   a   couple   a   days   ago ,    and .  .  .    well ,    it   doesn ['] t   do   king ['] s   book   justice   at   all .    they   just   weren ['] t   able   to   catch   its   thrilling   atmosphere ,    it   seems .    nor   its   main   concept ,    for   that   matter .    they   changed   a   lot   of   things   in   the   story ,    which   i   think   was   a   huge   mistake .    don ['] t   get   me   wrong ,    though .    the   original   story ['] s   so   long   that   they   would   have   no   choice   but   to   change   it   at   least   a   bit   while   writing   the   script .    otherwise ,    they   would   have   been   left   with   an   afternoon   movie   marathon   instead   of   a   regular   one .    but   the   thing   is ,    they   changed   some   things   that   should   have   by   no   means   been   changed .    and   worse .  .  .    they   changed   it   in   order   to   make   sure   the   audience   would   understand   the   plot .    and   that ['] s      pretty   much   the   same   as   calling   people   stupid .    they   messed   with   a   lot   of   things   concerning   the   story   in   the   book ,    but   the   worst   move   of   all   was   messing   with   the   ending .    by   doing   so ,    they   changed   its   essence   completely   and   screwed   its   concept   to   a   point   of   no   return .    and   all   for   the   sake   of   a   good   old   hollywood - like   ending .    big   no - no   right   there .    if   one   can ['] t   change   things   for   the   better ,    i   say   don ['] t   mess   around   and   stick   to   the   plan .    now   that   would   have   been   a   nice ,    smart   move .    anyways .  .  .    despite   all   the   mistakes   concerning   this   movie ,    the   story ['] s   still   good   enough   in   the   overall .    at   least   until   the   last   10   minutes   or   so .    then   things   really   start   going   down   the   drain .       and   to   think   this   movie   could   have   been   so   much   better   than   it   turned   out   to   be .  .  .       bet   you ['] ll   like   it   a   lot   more   if   you   haven ['] t   read   the   book   yet .
633723021	7987	2.5	boy ,    did   they   run   in   this   movie !    well ,    i   can ['] t   really   blame    ['] em .    i   would   have   ran   also ,    if   there   had   been   a   bunch   of   mutant   guys   trying   to   catch   me   and   cut   me   open   in   their   living   room .    some   freaky   hedious   creatures   there ,    i ['] ll   give    ['] em   that .    but   the   plot   is   really   just   like   any   other .    basically :    monsters    +    victims    =    victims   running   away   from   monsters .    and   there   it   is .    i   was   actually   able   of   describing   this   movie   in   one   simple   equation .    which   means   that   it   is   in   fact   a   rather   basic   movie .    the   good   thing   is   that   it   isn ['] t   all   that   boring .    it   somehow   manages   to   keep   you   interested   in   the   events   to   follow .    or ,    in   other   words ,    it   keeps   you   busy   trying   to   guess   who ['] s   going   to   be   killed   next   and   in   what   way .  .  .    oh ,    and   it   also   made   me   soooooo   frightened   that   i   am   actually   considering   not   going   to   the   woods   again   for   the   rest   of   my   life .  .  .    ok ,    no   i ['] m   not .  .  .    but   if   you   do   go   to   the   woods ,    pay   close   attention   to   the   road .    one   never   knows   which   maniacs   are   getting   ideas   from   these   sorts   of   movies .

126069564	3938	3.5	hilarity .
126069564	7521	3.0	yeah   it ['] s   amusing .    but   it ['] s   invented   for   17 - year - old   american   boys   with   the   iq   of   a   particularly   thick   slug .
126069564	4472	4.0	yeah ,    this   is   probably   the   only   romcom   i ['] m   into .    because   it ['] s   funny .    and   alan   rickman ['] s   in   it .    and   the   acting   kicks   bottom .

126069564	16879	3.0	a   bit   of   a   lovefest .    but   the   acting   was   good .    and   it   had   a   tragic   ending    * woots *

126069564	1962	2.0	it   was   a   pretty   good   concept .    and   good   acting .    but   i   only   went   to   see   it   because   i   couldn ['] t   get   in   to   see   eternal   sunshine .

353371552	10168	3.0	the   idea   is   there   but   its   not   entertaining   enough   for   me
353371552	6683	3.0	there   is   something   about   the   blood   and   gore   in   this   thet   stays   with   and   make   you   want   to   watch   it   again ,    although   be   wary   of   the   dog

353371552	15107	2.0	oddy   i   enjoy   oceans   12   more
353371552	10229	4.0	it   is      a   little   bit   long   and   there   are   times   when   you   need   to   have   read   the   book .    some   relationships   aren ['] t   shown   as   clear   as   they   should   be ,    howver   reese   witherspoon    ( who   actually   was   pregnant )    pulled   off   an   excelent   performance ,    i   wasn ['] t   sure   whether   to   admire   or   hate   her .    the   film   is   colourful   and   despite   not   being   entirly   true   to   the   novel
353371552	14754	2.0	is   there   any   difference   between   the   cxatoon   show   and   this .    except   that   it   runs   a   little   longer
353371552	5154	4.0	brilliant
353371552	15473	3.0	as   funny   as   ever
353371552	15474	1.5	i   didn ['] t   like   this   movie   it   seemed   to   be   a   repeat   of   so   many   other   films   trying   to   capture   the   mania   that   appears   to   be   the   life   of   a   rock   star
353371552	1843	3.5	the   bestv   on   out   of   the   beverly   hills   cop   films
353371552	3333	3.0	the   cast   are   fantastic   and   ther   is   an   element   of   surprise   but ,    i   didn ['] t   enjoy   it   as   much   as   i   had   expected   to .    it   was   somewhat   dread   and   the   thought   that   people   could   disappear   just   like   that   seemed   just   hard   to   believ   someone   has   to   notice   a   whole   village   going   missing
353371552	15471	3.0	a   little   boring
353371552	17149	3.5	after   this   film   i   took   a      second   look   at   robert   downy   jr
353371552	2112	1.0	to   understand   it   you   must   watch   it   more   then   once   but   i   could   not   appriciate   this   movie
353371552	3085	5.0	this   will   have   you   laughing   regardless   of   your   age
353371552	11886	5.0	this   is   a   classic   if   you   haven ['] t   seen   it   you   will .    it   is   brilliant ,    its   a   good   family   film .    i   love   it
353371552	7607	5.0	not   as   good   as   the   first   one ,    it   tends   to   capture   a   younger   audience
353371552	6255	5.0	i   wasn ['] t   sure   if   i   would   like   this   because   i   loved   the   tv   series   so   much .    but   i   sat   down   with   some   sweet   popcorn   and   at   the   end   of   the   film   i   felt   good .    this   film   is   magical   it   can   lift   you   heart   even   make   you   laugh   a   little
353371552	7004	2.0	this   film   lacks   what   the   other   two   had
353371552	1046	5.0	this   is   absolutly   brilliant .    i   recomend   it .    its   a   story   about   finding   yourself ,    there   is   a   messege   in   their   somewhere   for   everbody
353371552	1962	3.0	this   is      anice   feel   good   movie
353371552	3617	1.5	by   the   end   of   the   film   i   was   board
353371552	2776	0.5	the   secondfilm   that   i   have   ever   seen
353371552	8981	4.0	i   still   prefer   the   first   one ,    but   this   one   somehow   capturvated   me      near   the   end
353371552	4432	5.0	i   lovedthis   mark   whalberg   and   charlez   theoron   made   this   movie .
353371552	2783	5.0	i   loved   this   the   first   time   i   watched   it   was   sad   but   something   took   thta   sadness   away .    a   good   film
353371552	9442	4.5	this   film   seemed   to   have   more   spectacular   effect   then   the   first .    i ['] m   not   sure   that   people   would   put   the   two   films   together   if   they   didn ['] t   know   the   relationship
353371552	15034	5.0	signory   weaver   and   jenifer   love   do   such   a   good   job   in   this .    it   is   brilliant ,    and   not   the   sort   that   pulls   on   your   heart   strings
353371552	5807	5.0	this   is   a   real   uplifting   film .    it   shows   the   triumph   and   struggles   of   a   yourng   woman   as   she   suddenly   becomes   a   mum .    i   think   that   any   parent   can   identify   with   this   movie
353371552	13115	5.0	this   is   a   colourful   film .    it   is   lovely   but   at   the   begiining   you   really   need   a   heart   of   steal
353371552	3124	3.5	just   as   good   as   the   new   one
353371552	12694	4.0	a   really   great   fil ,    there   are   points   however   when   it   become   predictable

353371552	5088	5.0	this   is   film   that   i   recomend   that   everyone   sees   at   some   point   in   their   life
353371552	10886	5.0	this   is   brilliant ,    its   got   action   and   love   and      a   plot   that   can   be   followed .    there   is   also   the   added   bonus   that   it   is   beliveable    .    in   a   lot   of   years   time   it   could   happen
353371552	12115	5.0	this   is   so   good .    it   take   som   much   imaging # ation   yet   its   so   believable
353371552	13638	0.5	this   isn ['] t   evnen   worth   the   watching   it   is   not   like   the   first   on   the   actor   can ['] t   pull   off   the   role   and   gags   are   pointless

781939705	1180	4.0	this   movie   gets   a   lot   of   crap   because   ron   howard   and   the   screenwriters   took   some   liberties   with   the   reality   of   nash ['] s   life .    great   as   a   movie   though .
781939705	329	3.5	not   my   favorite   of   the   kevin   smith   films ,    but   still   one   of   my   favorite   ben   affleck   roles .
781939705	14050	2.5	maybe   because   i   saw   this   for   the   first   time   when   i   was   21 ,    but   this   seems   horribly   dated   to   me .    gene   wilder   is   good .

121860114	851	5.0	good   ol [']    west .    kinda   gives   me   a   depressing   mood   to   see   that   i   have   finished   the   trilogy .    wacky   and   fantastic
121860114	10358	3.5	this   wasn ['] t   as   great   as   the   first   one ,    but   i   love   the   idea   of   having   julia   roberts   play   julia   roberts .    however   the   idea   isn ['] t   new   to   me
121860114	14691	4.0	the   original   is   the   best
121860114	15205	5.0	made   me   think

121860114	798	4.5	it   was   a   really   great   movie .    especially   the   oxygen   tank
121860114	468	1.5	recommended   for   nerds .    i   don ['] t   even   get   a   thing ,    it   was   pretty   boring
121860114	4956	4.0	interesting ,    the   timeline   is   eccentric ,    but   fun   and   still   hilarious .    complicating   the   plot   is   what   it   counts
121860114	17508	4.0	though   the   film   mainly   focuses   on   the   effects   and   addiction   of   drugs . it   also   mentions   about   the   addiction   of   food ,    sex ,    stardom ,    televisiona   terrifying   story .    of   all   things   to   be   addicted   to ,    this   film   could   get   you   hooked ,    or   not

121860114	5692	4.0	pointless   entertainment ,    yet   funny   at   the   same   time .    but   anyone   who   has   watched   this   will   always   remember   the    " and   then "    or   that   tattoo   scene .
121860114	12546	3.0	original ,    i   think   the   second   one   is   better   though
121860114	3962	3.0	personification   is   all   they   do   to   lure   children ,    well   it ['] s   walt   disney   production .    yea ,    it   is   nice

808063221	15058	3.5	it   was   an   interesting   movie .    quite   dramatic .    loved   hugh   grant ['] s   acting   in   the   film ,    classic .    i ['] m   not   so   much   of   a   fan   of   julia   roberts   though ,    and   with   her   in   this   movie   acting   an    " actor "  .  .    yeah .
808063221	15062	3.5	it ['] s   pretty   much   a   classic    :  )
808063221	4384	4.0	i   actually   enjoyed   this ,    for   a   horror   flick .    an   interesting   change   from   the   resident   evil   zombies ,    which   are   a   bit   more   retarded   xd
808063221	13610	4.5	i   thought   the   original   spiderman   was   good .    tobey   macguire   plays   the   role   well .
808063221	14574	3.0	was   a   good   movie .
808063221	2186	3.5	a   comedy   action   that   is   just   a   must   see !     :  )
808063221	5967	3.5	i   think   this   ia   really   a   movie   that   appeals   to   your    " inner   child "    going   off   to   a   foreign   country   to   seek   adventure .  .  .     :  )    the   soundtrack   isn ['] t   too   bad   either .    some   parts   are   very   cheezy .  .  .
808063221	7664	5.0	another   epic   historical   film   that   i   enjoyed .    russell   crowe   does   a   very   powerful   performance   in   this   one .
808063221	17324	3.0	i   liked   this   movie .    i   related   to   some   parts   of   it ,    but   a   few   bits   were   a   bit .  .     *  * hmmm .  .  .  *  *    xd
808063221	5239	3.0	a   rehash   of   another   movie   i   have   already   seen ,    but   americanised .    i   love   chris   rock    -    he   helps   to   give   this   movie   a   few   more   laughs    :  )
808063221	2452	4.0	it   goes   hand   in   hand   with   the   rest   of   the   lotr   trilogy ,    but   i   think   that   it   was   a   tad   slow   and   i   got   this   feeling   that   the   movie   didn ['] t   really    *  * go *  *    anywhere .  .    but   it   did   set   the   scene   for   the   other   two .     :  )
808063221	7057	4.0	better   than   the   first ,    it   builds   on   the   lotr   trilogy   and   has   a   great   battle   scene   that   will   not   disappoint .    sets   the   scene   for   the   finale   and   third   chapter   of   the   lotr .
808063221	14550	5.0	actually   one   of   the   most   amazing   movies   i   have   ever   seen .    i   have   read   the   book   and   it ['] s   definately   well   translated   into   a   movie .    excellent   entertainment   value   and   a   great   thriller .    would   reccommend .
808063221	14545	3.5	i   can ['] t   remember   much   of   this   film   either .    it   is   a   jerry   bruckheimer   film   though   so   it   has   one   thing   going   for   it .    i   had   a   poster   of   it   up   on   my   wall   at   one   point   so   it   can ['] t   have   been    *  * too *  *    bad    ;  )
808063221	1865	3.0	it   was   a   very   strange   movie .    jim   carrey   did   his   usual   scream   into   the   middle   of   nowhere   thing ,    i ['] m   not   sure   whether   it   was   meant   to   be   a   comedy   or   what ,    but   i   think   i   was   left   more   confused   thatn   anything   else .
808063221	6552	1.5	very   average .    not   really   a   fan   of   the   charlie ['] s   angels   series .
808063221	9756	3.5	definately   has   it ['] s   funny   moments .    has   the   guy   off   armageddon   who   is   rather   entertaining .  .
808063221	7635	3.0	i   was   told   that   this   was   a   really   good   movie   by   a   bunch   of   friends ,    but   a   lot   of   it   i   thought   was   a   bit   just .  .  .    stupid .    there   were   entertaining   bits   though   and   there   are   some   taglines   that   stick   with   us    =  )
808063221	17293	3.0	nowhere   near   as   good   as   the   first   ring .    i   could   see   how   some   parts   people   might   find   scary   but   it   was   lacking   what   the   first   one   had .
808063221	6556	4.0	i   loved   this   adaption   of   the   original   play .    very   well   orchestrated .
808063221	5448	3.0	it   has   its   funny   moments .    some   of   these   guys   are   really   crazy !
808063221	5991	4.5	this   movie   had   quite   a   different   style ,    though   i   did   enjoy   it .    great   bast   and   interesting   storyline .
808063221	15078	3.0	it   was   ok .
808063221	3579	3.5	another   car   racing   movie .    soundtrack   isn ['] t   too   bad   though .
808063221	7828	5.0	luvved   this   movie !    had   a   good   twist   too .
808063221	1305	3.0	not   too   bad   a   movie ,    wasn ['] t   great   but   it   was   watchable .    those   girls   are   pretty   extreme .
808063221	15843	3.0	it   was   an   ok   movie .    storyline   was   average   and   really   all   it   had   going   for   it   was   chicks   in   bikinis .  .  .
808063221	5154	4.0	i   liked   this   movie .    partly   due   to   the   fact   it   had   keanu   reeves   in   it ,    there   are   some   entertaining   parts   and    " mannerisms "    that   you   might   recognise   from   the   matrix .    the   storyline   isn ['] t   too   bad .
808063221	4472	5.0	possibly   my   favourite   romantic   comedy .    i   love   hugh   grant   as   an   actor   and   it   has   a   great   cast ,    great   modern   soundtrack ,    and   an   excellent   storyline   that   ties   well   throughout   the   movie .    highly   reccommended .
808063221	10928	3.0	it ['] s   been   years   since   i ['] ve   watched   ace   ventura   but   jim   carrey   is   always   funny   in   these   movies .
808063221	15233	4.0	hillarious !    i   loved   the   part   about   the   center   for   ants .    my   favourite   ben   stiller   movie    ( even   though   i   don ['] t   like   him   all   that   much )    and   great   for   a   fun ,    silly   movie .
808063221	4956	3.0	this   one   really   got   a   bit   far   fetched .    it   is   funny   seeing   what   they   thought   the   future   would   be   like   near   30   years   from   when   the   movie   was   made   though   xd
808063221	6859	2.5	it   was   a   pretty   average   movie .  .  .
808063221	8764	4.0	i ['] ve   always   liked   happy   gilmore   for   some   reason .    probably   one   of   adam   sandler ['] s   best   performances .
808063221	14149	4.5	another   one   of   my   favourite   movies .    it   is   interesting   and   a   tad   freaky   to   think   about   how   much   of   this   stuff   they   can   actually   do   with   todays   technology .    will   smith   does   a   great   job   in   acting   in   this   one   as   usual    :  )
808063221	4216	0.5	terrible   movie .    the   ending   was   as   equally   terrible .
808063221	6365	2.5	i   can ['] t   remember   what   was   so   bad   about   this ,    but   i   don ['] t   remember   it   being   that   entertaining .    the   only   thing   going   for   it   really   was   orlando   bloom ,    but   i   remember   feeling   really   disappointed   with   this   one .
808063221	9800	3.0	wasn ['] t   too   bad   a   movie .    it   was   a   bit   far   fetched   though .  .    some   parts   did   make   me   laugh .
808063221	12838	4.5	i   love   this   movie .    maybe   it ['] s   the   irish   accent .    xd   it ['] s   an   action   comedy ,    but   really   goes   in   with   movies   like   lock   stock ,    etc .    if   you   like   them   you ['] ll   love   this .    reccommended .
808063221	3254	4.0	one   of   the   best   out   of   the   marvell   series .
808063221	4432	3.5	i   actually   really   enjoyed   this .    it   had   the   same   kinda    " thriller "    thing   as    " oceans .  .  .  "    but   with   minis   and   also   charlize   theron .     :  )
808063221	2782	4.5	it ['] s   a   classic .    mel   gibson   does   great   in   this   one ,    and   i   love   the   scottish   music   played   throughout .
808063221	9591	1.5	didn ['] t   think   it   was   that   great .    a   bit   childish ,    it   has   funny   parts   here   and   there   though .
808063221	16882	3.0	didn ['] t   really   enjoy   it   all   that   much .    in   fact   i   think   jack   nicholson   annoyed   me   xd
808063221	17088	3.5	it   wasn ['] t   as   funny   as   people   made   it   out   to   be ,    but   some   parts   made   me   laugh .     :  )
808063221	10421	3.5	i   don ['] t   really   remember   much   of   it ,    but   it   was   funny   at   some   parts .  .    so   it   gets   a   just   higher   than   pass   rating    :  )
808063221	12238	4.0	i   thought   this   movie   was   hillarious .     :  )
808063221	9340	4.0	it ['] s   getting   up   to   those   epic   movies   but   there   is   something   about   it   that   holds   it   back .  .    possibly   the   ending .    the   love   story   and   most   of   the   storyline   is   good   though .
808063221	12546	2.0	it   was   good   back   in   the   day ,    especially   when   i   was   a   little   kid ,    but   i   think   it ['] d   be   a   bit   childish   now .    some   parts   would   probably   make   me   laugh   though    :  )
808063221	3713	4.5	if   you   like   horrors   and   horrors   with   a   twist ,    this   is   definately   a   movie   you   need   to   see .    it ['] s   low   budget   but   it   really   does   make   you   cringe   xd   when   you   reach   the   end   everything   will   click   into   place .    great   entertainment   value ,    but   watch   the   sadistic   part   of   it .
808063221	16879	4.5	i ['] ve   seen   this   movie   twice .  .    it   is   good ,    very   emotional ,    backed   up   with   a   powerful   storyline   and   good   actors .
808063221	6347	1.5	it   was   funny   at   parts ,    but   over   the   top   most   of   the   time .
808063221	13102	3.5	it   was   a   pretty   alright   movie .    watchable .     :  )
808063221	14691	5.0	probably   my   favourite   sc - fi   movie    -    completely   mind   blowing   with   the   philosophy   along   with   the   computer   generated   effects   such   as   bullet   time .    highly   reccommended .
808063221	11283	4.5	i   love   this   movie .    tom   hanks   is   an   amazing   actor .
808063221	3938	4.5	hillarious !  !    i   always   luvved   shrek    :  )    donkey ,    and   puss   in   boots   are   my   favourites .
808063221	10170	4.0	i   enjoyed   it .
808063221	2617	1.0	this   was   actually   a   terrible   movie .    not   scary   and   i   actually   found   myself   looking   at   the   time   to   see   how   much   longer   this   movie   was   going   to   go   for   xd
808063221	4260	2.0	some   parts   were   funny .    rowan   atkinson   was   good   in   it   with   his   mr .    beanish   style   antics   but   he   didn ['] t   play   much   in   the   movie .    based   off   a   similar   movie   i ['] ve   seen   before .
808063221	14940	1.5	i   actually   thought   this   movie   was   stupid .    some   parts   were   funny ,    but   on   the   whole   i   didn ['] t   like   it .
808063221	673	5.0	probably   a   cult   classic .    and   i ['] ve   seen   it   many   times   and   still   think   it ['] s   a   good   movie .    it   has   a   lot   to   think   about   and   you   seem   to    " unlock "    or   figure   out   more   each   time   you   see   it .    great   thriller   and   brad   pitt   does   well   in   this   one .
808063221	17479	4.5	my   favourite   horror .    i   love   the   concept   and   the   very   subtle   creepy   music   always   gets   to   me .    great   if   you ['] re   in   a   dark   room   by   yourself   if   you ['] re   game .  .  .     = d
808063221	3151	4.0	goooood   movie .    you   either   love   napoleon   dynamite   of   you   hate   it ,    the   humour   is   quite   unique .
808063221	3962	4.5	one   of   my   favourite   computer   animated   movies .     =  )
808063221	16640	3.0	i   didn ['] t   really   think   that   this   movie   was   that   great .  .    from   memory   i   was   a   bit   disppointed   really .
808063221	4996	3.5	a   good   movie .    more   awe   value   on   the   cars .
808063221	3138	4.5	my   favourite   of   the   blade   series .    everything   is   very   slick ,    very   modern   and   it   has .  .    vampires   of   course !     = d   jessica   biel   also   makes   an   appearance   which   really   gives   it   that   extra   1 / 2 - star    = d
808063221	12494	3.5	another   sniper   movie .    it   was   quite   good ,    though   a   bit   americanised / overly   patriotic ,    etc .  .  .
808063221	17169	4.5	i   really   enjoyed   this   one .    i   think   nicholas   cage   is   a   superb   actor ,    and   he   does   a   brilliant   job   in   this   one .    i   think   i ['] ve   seen   this   movie   a   few   times   and   i   can ['] t   wait   to   see   the   second   one .
808063221	10358	4.0	wasn ['] t   a   bad   movie .    got   a   bit   confused   at   one   point   but   as   usual   a   good   thriller   with   a   very   interesting   twist   at   the   end    :  )
808063221	6400	4.5	i   think   while   watching   this   movie   i   kept   thinking   how   crazy   it   was   that   it   actually   happened .  .    great   movie   though .
808063221	7499	4.5	probably   one   of   the   movies   that   got   me   into   will   smith .    a   really   great   movie ,    there ['] a   a   lot   of   stuff   that   is   a   bit    ( err )    but   a   popcorn   movie ,    there ['] s   no   doubt   about   that .
808063221	5862	3.0	i   had   been   reccommended   this   movie   from   a   friend   and   it   sounded   like   a   really   good   concept   for   a   movie ,    it   was   actually   pretty   good   but   i   got   confused   about   halfway   and   especially   near   the   end .    i   probably   wouldn ['] t   mind   seeing   it   again   to   really   understand   it   properly .
808063221	11077	4.0	i   thought   that   this   sequel   was   a   bit   more   entertaining   than   the   original .
808063221	15205	4.5	i   really   did   enjoy   this   movie .    it   had   a   great   storyline   and   linked   well   together   despite   switching   to   many   locations .    excellent   computer   animation   too .
808063221	10820	4.0	the   original   back   to   the   future .    i   love   michael   j .    fox ['] s   acting !    this   one   is   definately   the   best   of   the   three .
808063221	9637	4.0	i   actually   really   enjoyed   this   movie .    tom   cruise   does   a   great   job   in   this   one ,    famous   for   his   line    " show   me   the   money !  "    great   storyline   and   reminded   me   a   lot   of   the   pursuit   of   happyness .  .    there   was   a   bit   too   much   dialogue ,    else   it   would   be   4 . 5   stars .    recommended .
808063221	7511	3.0	i   like   the    " look "    of   blade .    very   smooth .    can ['] t   remember   much   f   this   storyline   though .
808063221	3925	3.5	the   second   part   of   the   matrix   trilogy .    probably   my   least   favourite   of   the   lot .
808063221	12497	3.0	not   great ,    but   not   overly   terrible   either .    wouldn ['] t   see   any   of   the   numerous   sequels   though   xd
808063221	14248	3.5	ice   hockey !     = d
808063221	205	5.0	always   liked   historical   movies .  .  .    brad   pitt   does   a   great   job .    epic .     :  )
808063221	6978	3.0	this   was   funny   at   some   parts ,    but   i   think   i   was   disappointed   as   my   friends   told   me   it   was   really   good .  .  .
808063221	6037	4.0	it   had   a   good   storyline .    something   a   bit   different ,    with   plenty   of   action .
808063221	2372	3.5	it   was   not   too   bad .    the   action   scenes   didn ['] t   disappoint   but   they   are   milking   this   series   for   all   it   is   worth
808063221	1975	3.0	was   very   average .  .  .
808063221	14869	3.0	quite   an   interesting   movie .    it   has   some   pretty   deep   themes   with   it ,    the   movie   was   a   bit   dark   and   the   storyline   a   tad   confusing   at   places .    i   thought   it   was   quite   funny   seeing   how   a   1980 ['] s   movie   thought   things   would   look   30   years   from    " then "    xd   entertainment   factor   was   a   bit   lacking   though .  .    a   lil   too   much   dialogue   for   me !
808063221	15107	4.5	it   had   a   great   cast   and   from   memory   it   was   a   very   entertaining   movie   to   watch .    i   loved   the   twist .
808063221	3638	4.5	i   love   this   movie .  .  .    love   will   smith   and   martin   lawrence .  .     :  )    it   is   a   bit   long   though .
808063221	468	4.0	ties   up   the   series ,    it ['] s   entertaining   and   then   try   to   make   it   as   big   as   the   original ,    but   it   doesn ['] t    *  * quite *  *    get   there .    and   way   toooo   much   philosophical   stuff .
808063221	6994	3.0	this   was   an   ok   movie .  .    i   found   the   storyine   a   bit   far   fetched ,    a   bit   too   over   thte   top   in   places ,    although   it   is   meant   to   be   a   comedy .    matthew   perry   gives   a   performance   which   reminded   me   a   lot   of   friends .    watchable ,    but   not   a   favourite .
808063221	16707	3.5	from   memory   it   was   a   pretty   funny   movie .    well   i ['] ve   seen   it   at   least   twice   so   it   can ['] t   be   too   bad    ;  )
808063221	15471	4.5	for   a   movie   based   around   a   single   location :    a   phone   booth   it   is   really   well   done .    a   great   thriller   and   i   would   really   reccommend .
808063221	4829	4.0	i   thought   this   was   a   great   take   on   dawn   of   the   dead .    i   found   it   quite   a   laugh ,    the   pommy   humour   is   great .    good   for   the   light   hearted   comedic   take   on   the   original   zomble   flick .
808063221	11337	4.5	very ,    very   funny   movie .
808063221	12471	4.0	i   was   very   skeptical   when   going   to   see   a   movie   based   on   eminem ['] s   life .    but   was   pleasantly   surprised .    the   the   impromptu   freestyling   at   the   end   is   incredible !
808063221	1962	3.5	it   was   funny .
808063221	3890	2.5	i   remember   missing   some   parts ,    and   it   was   a   bit   boring   at   certain   places .    i   think   the   only   real   thing   going   for   it   was   lindsay   lohan .
808063221	5793	3.5	it   is   a   good   movie   if   you   like   vampires   and   warewolves .     =  )
808063221	14909	4.0	i   wanted   to   watch   this   after   hearing    " goo   goo   dolls    -    iris "  .    it   was   actually   a   pretty   good   movie .    a   bit   sad   though .     :  (
808063221	3385	4.0	for   a   low   budget   zombie   flick ,    this   movie   does   a   really   good   job   in   both   the   horror   department   and   entertainment   department .    also   goes   with   a   bit   more   lievely   zombies   than   in   resident   evil .    if   you   like   zombie   flicks ,    you   definately   have   to   see   this   one .
808063221	10275	4.0	well   it   does   have   elisha   cuthbert   in   it .     :  )    it   was   quite   a   good   movie ,    i   enjoyed   it .
808063221	7032	3.0	i   never   really   liked   the   austin   powers   series   that   much ,    but   i   do   admit   that   some   parts   can   be   quite   funny .
808063221	14312	3.5	ahhh   it ['] s   a   classic .    this   is   the   only   one   i   like   out   of   the   series ,    it ['] s   a   good   movie   and   the   realism   of   the   dinosaurs   is   incredible ,    as   is   some   of   the   setting .
808063221	14313	3.5	i   watched   this   movie   a   few   months   ago   and   it   was   quite   good .    not   so   good   for   historical   value   but   does   make   for   a   good   movie .
808063221	14621	4.5	loved   it !     :  )
808063221	16984	0.5	i   got   halfway   through   this   movie   and   then   decided   that   it   actually   wasn ['] t   worth   finishing ,    that ['] s   how   bad   it   was   xd
808063221	483	4.5	hillarious !    the   best   of   the   rush   hour   series   and   always   makes   me   laugh    :  )
676375419	14691	5.0	matrix   rocks .    great   movie   and   how   we   can   be   in   the   world   of   matrix
676375419	2985	2.0	okay   but   not   as   funny   as   other   movies   in   this   type .

676375419	2782	2.0	mel   gibson   played   a   good   role   but   did   not   like   the   story   line .    and   plot
676375419	1905	3.0	okay   but   slept   threw   most   of   it .    so   cannot   really   tell   you   what   happen .

676375419	10583	2.0	funny   jack   black   but   story   was   kind   of   childish
676375419	5571	5.0	now   were   talking . his   movies   are   great .    how   he   succeed   to   achieve   to   beat   people   and   be   top   of   world   boxing .

676375419	1962	4.0	funny   how   he   tried   and   get   this   girl   by   buildin   bridge .    haha
522460410	550	5.0	i   love   this   movie ,    i   know   its   corny   but   it   is   a   sweet   version   of   the   arthur   and   camelot   stories .    i   think   that   sean   connery   does   a   great   job   in   the   role   of   arthur   as   well   as   richard   gere   as   lancelot ,    however ,    i   think   that   they   could   have   found   a   better   actress   to   play   guinevere .
522460410	5705	4.0	people   complain   that   they   didn ['] t   like   this   one ,    personally   i   thought   it   was   a   very   good   one   in   comparison   to   episode   1 .
522460410	4266	4.5	this   is   such   a   touching   movie .    i   cried   through   the   parts   that   needed   tears   and   all .       it   made   me   think   of   the   suffering   that   christ   did   suffer .
522460410	15902	5.0	" if   an   episode   of   walker   texas   ranger   changed   your   life ,    you   might   be   a   redneck .  "     -    jeff   foxworthy      if   you   like   backwood   comedy   and   think   your   a   redneck    ( i   don ['] t   think   i   am ,    i   know   i   am )    you   will   love   this   movie .
522460410	17482	4.0	this   movie   might   not   be   the   best ,    but   i   give   it   such   a   high   rating   since   it   lets   me   go   back   to   my   junior   high   school   days .       its   just   a   stuck   up   funny   moive   that   allows   the   typical   blonde   to   learn   a   lesson   that   appearances   are   not   the   important   thing ,    but   what   is   on   the   inside   that   counts .
522460410	1905	5.0	i   figured   i   wouldn ['] t   like   this   movie   so   it   took   me   until   pirates   2   came   out   to   actually   watch   this   movie   and   i   ended   up   loving   it .
522460410	11283	5.0	this   is   one   of   the   best   tom   hanks   movies   i   have   ever   saw .       you   are   able   to   relate   to   the   character   of   forrest   through   all   the   events   of   his   life   and   it   makes   it   feel   real ,    not   fake   like   many   movie .  .  .    why   can ['] t   hollywood   make   more   movies   like   this ?  ?
522460410	12071	4.5	borrowed   this   from   zack   too ,    and   it   was   just   as   funny   as   clerks .       especially   the   part   at   the   psychic .
522460410	4136	2.0	i   saw   this   a   long   time   ago ,    and   for   what   it   was   its   okay ,    but   nothing   that   i   would   watch   again   and   again
522460410	14103	5.0	if   you   haven ['] t   read   the   book ,    you   should .    the   movie   is   great ,    but   the   book   is   even   better .
522460410	9628	4.0	i   thought   that   this   was   the   best   of   all   of   the   movies .       it   is   sad   that   this   was   and   is   said   to   be   the   end   of   the   series .       the   one   element   that   kept   me   coming   back   always   to   the   series   was   yoda   and   i   was   sad   to   see   him   die   in   this   movie .       it   is   a   little   akward   in   the   beginning   but   things   pick   up   as   things   get   started .       great   movie .
522460410	11525	4.0	for   being   the   second   sequal   to   the   original ,    its   better   than   the   return   of   jafar .
522460410	15062	4.0	what   can   i   say .  .  .    classic
522460410	12785	3.0	i   was   actually   pretty   pleased   with   this   movie   to   be   completely   honest .       i   haven ['] t   watched   it   in   a   while   but   i   found   it   to   be   a   good   watch   and   many   of   the   characters   are   there   but   though   the   story   goes   in   a   different   direction   than   what   it   was   in   both   the   comics   and   the   cartoons   of   90 ['] s .
522460410	7416	5.0	this   is   the   best   movie   of   all   time   in   my   book .       know   its   long   but   its   just   a   classic .       i   know   it   doesn ['] t   fit   with   my   other   all   time   favorites ,    but   it   is   a   true   love   story   and   has   a   great   cast   and   it   is   full   of   great   lines   that   many   people   still   quote .  .  .    espeically .  .  .     " frankly   my   dear .  .  .    i   don ['] t   give   a   damn .  .  "
522460410	17499	4.0	some   would   argure   that   this   isn ['] t   one   of   the   better   disney   movies ,    but   i   love   the   cricket ,    he   makes   the   movie .
522460410	3817	3.0	i   always   watched   these   types   of   movies   with   my   dad .    i   just   liked   the   movie   in   general   though   it   is   kinda   dry   in   spots .
522460410	15532	5.0	i   know   this   is   a   teen   movie ,    but   i   love   how   the   outcast   gets   excepted   in   the   end .       i   completely   relate   to   that .
522460410	13501	4.0	i   am   kinda   tired   of   them   killing   off   characters ,    but   i   thought   that   this   was   a   great   film .       it   was   an   improvement   on   some   elements   in   comparison   to   iii .       i   personally   enjoy   underdog   movies   and   that   is   what   the   whole   series   is .       if   you   like   these   types   of   movies ,    this   movie   is   for   you .
522460410	7057	5.0	thought   that   this   movie   was   a   little   dark ,    and   it   isn ['] t   as   confusing   as   the   book   so   i   enjoyed   it .
522460410	2452	4.5	this   was   a   great   movie ,    but   like   the   book ,    it   was   mostly   set   up   for   the   rest   of   the   trilogy ,    but   it   was   enjoyable .
522460410	9614	5.0	i   really   liked   this   movie .  .  .    i   was   really   worried   that   it   wouldn ['] t   live   up   to   the   level   of   the   original ,    but   i   thought   it   was   really   good .       i   loved   the   family   element   that   was   present   and   the   love   and   devotion   of   rocky .       it   is   one   that   shows   that   hard   work   in   the   end   wins   out   in   the   end .
522460410	11443	4.0	this   movie   is   good ,    but   the   book   is   so   much   better .
522460410	8904	5.0	this   is   a   great   movie .       i   personally   think   its   the   best   matt   damom   movie   ever ,    but   i   am   more   into   action   movies   which   is   why   it   is   lower   on   my   list   in   comparison   to   the   bourne   movies .
522460410	788	4.5	borrowed   this   one   from   my   friend   zack ,    and   i   loved   it .       it   has   very   deep   comic   remarks   that   make   you   think ,    especially   since   the   remarks   come   from   complete   stoners .
522460410	3195	5.0	this   is   one   of   the   best   movies   on   wwii   that   i   have   ever   saw   and   this   is   coming   from   a   history   nerd .
522460410	13315	4.0	for   being   a   movie ,    it   stays   pretty   close   to   the   book
522460410	6001	3.5	personally ,    i   found   this   to   be   a   cute   movie   the   last   time   i   watched   it   and   that   has   been   a   while   back .  .  .    so   i   rate   it   with   caution   and   found   memories .
522460410	13860	3.0	this   is   a   good   movie   for   what   it   is .
522460410	2590	4.0	i   am   not   a   huge   musical   fan ,    but   i   really   like   this   one .
522460410	46	4.5	this   is   a   christmas   classic
522460410	7624	5.0	the   movie   was   great   and   so   was   its   soundtrack
522460410	9757	5.0	i   love   this   movie .  .  .    corny   yes ,    but   it   is   just   a   feel   good   movie .
522460410	6961	4.0	this   movie   is   so   stupid   at   times   it   makes   it   funny .       the   narrator   is   the   best   part !
522460410	5571	4.0	how   can   you   not   love   this   movie .  .  .    its   a   classic .
522460410	6287	4.0	this   movie   is   just   a   pure   classic   and   everyone   should   see   it   at   least   once .
522460410	6119	0.5	i   love   matt   damon ,    and   this   movie   is   the   worst   one   i   have   ever   seen   him   in .    this   movie   was   not   even   in   his   ball   park   of   semi - good   performances .    stick   to   the   movies   like   ocean ['] s   eleven ,    or   the   bourne   series .
522460410	9886	3.0	i   felt   that   this   movie   was   very   weak   and   not   that   great   in   comparison   to   the   original   three .       it   serves   its   purpose   of   setting   up   for   episodes   2    &    3 ,    but   i   feel   that   is   about   it .
522460410	14953	4.0	i   actually   really   liked   this   movie .       at   first   i   didn ['] t   think   it   was   going   to   be   that   good ,    but   things   eventually   turned   around   and   i   really   enjoyed   it .
522460410	6972	4.0	this   movie   was   just   great   and   has   an   even   better   soundtrack .
522460410	11218	5.0	i   have   watched   this   movie   i   don ['] t   know   how   many   times   and   i   never   get   tired   of   seeing   it .       i   think   that   it   has   a   perfect   cast   to   portray   both   the   girls   in   the   70s   and   the   women   of   now .
522460410	896	5.0	i   love   the   soundtrack   to   this   movie .       i   have   it   downloaded   to   my   computer   and   it   is   great .
522460410	17134	4.0	love   this   movie
522460410	6037	5.0	i   am   totally   into   action   movies   and   i   love   matt   damon .       so   this   movie   was   awesome .       i   love   the   locations   to   which   this   movie   went   and   that   matt   damon   appears   to   be   made   to   play   the   role   of   jason   bourne .       i   find   this   to   be   one   of   the   best   movies   that   damon   ever   performed   in   besides   good   will   hunting .       this   movie   is   one   that   shows   all   the   strengths   he   has   and   everyone   that   likes   action   and   the   spy   movie   element   would   love   this   movie .
522460410	15844	5.0	this   movie   is   wonderful .  .  .    the   cast   was   well   picked   and   the   story   was   compeling   to   see .       this   movie   shows   how   people   that   are   discriminated   against   can   stand   tall   and   over   come   what   is   before   them .
522460410	6497	3.5	very   interesting   movie .       odd ,    but   good .
522460410	3463	5.0	i   love   this   movie .  .  .    it   tells   how   you   can   hate   someone   and   still   love   them   at   the   same   time .  .  . i   guess   i   understand   kat ['] s   point   of   view ,    since   i   feel   that   way   about   one   person   as   well .
522460410	12262	5.0	this   is   a   classic   that ,    if   you   haven ['] t   at   least   seen   it   once ,    you ['] ve   been   living   in   a   box .
522460410	15107	5.0	this   movie   is   great .       its   got   a   great   cast   and   it   keeps   you   on   your   toes .       it   is   very   witty   and   fun   to   watch .       it   is   hard   to   follow   this   movie   with   a   sequel   which   has   occurred .       personally   i   think   it   is   better   than   12 .
522460410	5181	4.0	this   isn ['] t   a   movie   that   i   would   watch   all   the   time ,    but   i   was   very   touched   with   how   this   movie   turned   out .       it   is   a   total   chick   flick ,    but   if   you   need   a   good   chick   movie ,    this   is   for   you .
522460410	11337	4.0	this   has   the   makings   to   be   a   cult   classic .       it   is   funny   and   the   characters   are   rememberable .
522460410	9438	4.5	this   movie   has   it   all   for   both   men   and   women ,    romance   for   the   woman ,    and   basketball   for   men .       this   movie   is   one   of   my   personal   favorites   and   would   tell   anyone   to   see   it .       double   or   nothing .  .  .
522460410	2122	3.5	this   was   a   rather   strange   movie ,    but   i   did   like   it .       i   would   warn   you   that   it   doesn ['] t   make   that   much   sense   at   times ,    its   just   a   fun   movie   to   watch .
522460410	12470	4.0	i   could   complain   about   a   lot   of   stuff   in   concern   to   this   movie ,    but   i   won ['] t .       i   found   it   very   entertaining   and   i   have   watched   it   numerous   times .       i   know   some   of   the   effects   aren ['] t   the   best ,    but   its   just   an   overall   good   watch   if   you   need   something   that   is   unlike   something   you   would   normally   watch .
522460410	329	4.5	just   flat   out   funny
522460410	2779	0.5	i   hated   this   moive   with   a   passion ,    i   thought   that   this   movie   was   too   hyped   up   for   what   it   ended   up   being .
522460410	2783	3.0	corny   yes ,    but   its   got   a   lot   of   funny   moments .
522460410	8989	4.0	i   like   julia   stiles   and   i   thought   that   she   does   an   awesome   job   in   this   movie .
522460410	15582	5.0	this   is   a   sweet   movie .       makes   you   think   about   a   lot   of   stuff   while   you   are   watching   it .       it   might   be   a   sappy   chick   flick   but   its   a   good   movie .       can ['] t   beat   the   music   either .
522460410	14909	4.0	i   don ['] t   like   nicholas   cage .  .  .    but   this   is   a   good   movie   and   i   thought   that   he   acted   very   well   in   this   movie .       i   felt   that   meg   ryan   did   as   super   job   as   well .       its   a   great   love   story   in   the   end   and   everything .       this   is   a   movie   that   most   chicks   would   like .
522460410	6235	4.5	the   book   is   sooo   much   better   so   if   you   like   the   movie   pick   up   the   book .
522460410	9340	4.0	another   historically   lacking   film ,    but   if   you   are   looking   for   a   good   love   story   with   a   pretty   good   battle   sequence .  .  .    this   is   your   film .
522460410	3239	5.0	this   movie   is   very   cute   and   very   enjoyable .       i   have   actually   read   the   books   and   it   is   very   far   from   what   meg   cabot   is   writing   and   she   even   jokes   about   it   in   one   of   the   books   how   different   this   movie   is   from   the   book .       but   this   a   very   sweet   movie   and   people   should   really   see   it   if   they   haven ['] t   yet .
522460410	16879	4.0	i   like   this   movie .  .  .    its   just   long .  .  .    and   at   times   well   kinda   boring   in   places .       the   music   in   this   movie   was   wonderful   and   was   very   appropriate .       i   know   why   it   recieved   all   the   awards   that   it   did ,    because   it   was   a   great   film .       but   all   great   films   have   flaws .
522460410	12672	4.5	i   finally   got   to   sit   down   and   watch   this   one   and   it   was   a   very   moving   movie   that   kept   you   wondering   to   the   very   end .       i   would   have   done   the   same   thing   in   john ['] s   place   too .
522460410	5088	5.0	this   is   a   classic .    if   you   haven ['] t   seen   this   movie ,    watch   it   at   least   once .
522460410	13102	5.0	this   is   a   good   movie   for   people   that   want   to   see   that   dreams   do   come   true ,    at   least   in   the   movies   they   do .       i   love   the   soundtrack   as   well .
522460410	14312	1.0	this   movie   wasn ['] t   that   great .       i   have   seen   better    &    personally   i   think   lost   world   was   ten   times   better .
522460410	10282	2.0	i ['] ve   seen   parts   of   this   movie   and   it   was   hyped   up   too   much   and   i   thought   it   was   a   little   disappointing   when   you   saw   it .
522460410	1558	4.0	i   am   not   usuaully   a   huge   fan   of   sequals   due   to   the   fact   that   they   are   never   as   good   as   the   first .       however ,    the   entire   series   has   been   very   well   crafted   and   acted .       i   personally   love   the   fact   that   rocky   lost   everything   and   had   to   go   back   to   the   old   neighborhood   to   start   again .       plus   i   loved   how   the   movie   didn ['] t   end   in   the   ring   like   the   others ,    but   with   the   street   fight   between   tommy   gunn   and   rocky .
522460410	14313	4.0	this   movie   is   very   good ,    but   historically   very   bad .       but   without   looking   at   the   historic   part ,    it   is   well   written   and   has   a   good   cast .
522460410	8851	4.5	this   movie   has   some   of   the   best   opening   quotes   ever   and   i   like   to   use   them   at   unique   times !  !
782166339	4402	5.0	nightmare   on   elm   street   quite   possibly   has   one   of   the   greatest   concepts   for   a   horror   story   ever .    while   the   acting   isn ['] t   award   winning   and   time   has   caused   the   special   effects   to   seem   not   so   special ,    it   still   does   what   so   many   modern   day   horror   films   fail   to   do :    make   you   scared   to   fall   asleep .
782166339	11077	3.5	a   fun   movie ,    i   enjoyed   it .

782166339	1905	3.0	i   choose   to   lower   the   rating   of   this   film   because   of   everyone   who   thinks   this   series   is   the   greatest   thing   since   pre - sliced   bread .    pirates   suck .

782166339	12881	4.5	possibly   one   of   the   strangest   films   i ['] ve   ever   seen .    therefore ,    it   rocks .    the   music   was   amazing .    therefore   it   rocks .    i   gave   it   a   4   1 / 2   star   rating .    therefore   it   rocks .

456850028	2452	5.0	my   favorite   out   of   the   lotr   trilogy .    i   was   always   more   of   a   sci - fi   buff   than   a   fantasy   nerd ,    so   i   was   a   little   skeptical   going   into   lotr .    although   there   was   something   magical   about   peter   jackson ['] s   tolkien   adaptation   that   captured   my   imagination   once   the   title   blurb   appeared   and   cate   blanchett ['] s   voiceover   began .    and   then   i   was   in   love .    this   movie   reminds   me   of   playing   rpgs ,    where   you   start   off   on   a   quest   and   later   find   yourself   recruiting   new   members .    that   very   same   feeling   of   meeting   new ,    powerful   allies   enveloped   me   when   the   movie   really   began   to   take   off   once   they   left   for   mordor .    since   peter   jackson   was   a   horror   director ,    he   manages   to   project   a   sense   of   terror   and   dread   from   such   an   unsuspecting   movie ,    and   i   loved   that   quality   about   it .       it   does   lack   the   sheer   epic   feel   of   the   next   two   installments ,    but   it   makes   up   for   it   in   its   complexity .    i      like   how   in   this   movie   the   black   and   white   distinctions   between   the   heros   and   villians   are   not   as   clean - cut   as   the   following   movies .    the   heros   could   very   well   become   villians   once   they   were   tempted   by   the   ring ,    so   nobody   was   inherently   good   or   bad .    there   were   grey   characters   like   boromir   and   some   racial   tension   between   gimli   and   legolas .    the   following   movies   had   a   more   clearer   distinction   overall ,    but   the   first   movie   had   that   darker   quality   that   evil   was   pervading   and   that   was   a   little   more   parallel   to   reality   than   the   other   two   movies .    an   exceptional   film ,    and   the   greatest   trilogy   out   there ,    barely   trumping   star   wars ,    the   lotr   is   a   masterpiece   in   its   own   grand   scheme   of   things .

161191306	5788	3.5	wow .  .  . good   movie ,    but   you   have   to   have   a   certain   mindset   when   you   watch   it .    billy   bob   is   quite   entertaining   at   times .

161191306	6223	4.0	so   this   one   is   a   guilty   pleasure   of   mine .    i   dunno .  .  . maybe   its   the   ronald   reagan      mask   that   does   it .  .  .
161191306	16377	3.5	definitely   an   interesting   movie .    i   think   its   unfair   to   try   to   compare   it   to   forrest   gump ,    but   the   movie   has   some   wonderful   qualities   of   itself   and   i   think   those   should   really   be   appreciated .    michael   clarke   duncan   gives   one   of   the   best   performances   i ['] ve   ever   seen   out   of   him   and   tom   hanks   ceases   to   amaze   with   yet   another   wonderful   performance   of   his   own .
161191306	2430	3.5	pretty   good .  .  . especially   with   friends   late   at   night .  .  . and   then   realizing   that   bilbo   baggins   is   the   crazy   robot   science   officer .

161191306	7233	4.5	i   really   liked   it .  .  . but   then   again   i ['] m   weird .
161191306	9882	3.5	good   little   sci - fi   flick .  .  . if   not   somewhat   of   a   guilty   pleasure .    not   groundbreaking   by   any   stretch   of   the   imagination ,    but   still   pretty   decent .

853925151	14691	2.5	never   understood   the   crazy   fanbase   for   this   movie .
853925151	2985	3.0	cameron   diaz   is   so   perfect   in   this   film    ( which   is   kinda   the   point )    but   i   still   think   she   manages   to   come   across   with   a   good   character .    someone   still   interesting   to   watch .
853925151	11077	3.5	good   movie .    deniro   is   a   god .    stillers   ok ,    i   guess    :     )
853925151	15107	4.5	great   cast .
853925151	2782	4.5	aaahhh .    back   when   mel   gibson   was   making   decent   movies .    well ,    its   still   a   classic .
853925151	1905	4.0	goiing   to   end   up   being   a   classic .    johnny   depp   rules .
853925151	14103	1.5	again   waaay   too   chick   flicky .    ryan   gosling   is   sexy   as   hell   though .
853925151	3320	4.0	hugh   grant   is   an   endearing   asshole   in   this   film .    if   that   makes   sense ?
853925151	6235	0.5	i   loathe   mandy   moore   in   this   film .    she   could   not   have   been   more   disgusting   sweet .    it   was   overkill .    bigtime .    she   is   almost   painfull   to   watch   her   acting   is   so   fucking   awful .
853925151	10583	1.5	like   jack   black   but   this   didn ['] t   do   it   for   me .    loud   doesn ['] t   mean   funny .

853925151	5571	4.5	classic .    love   it .
853925151	7664	2.5	phoenix    ( is   that   spelled   right ?  )    kept   this   movie   interesting   for   me ,    but   that   was   about   it .
853925151	16879	4.5	this   is   a   great   film ,    even   though   its   been   a   while   since   i ['] ve   seen   it .    i   remember   all   the   buzz   about   it   when   it   was   released   and   it   is   knda      joked   about   and   spoofed      a   lot   now   but   a   don ['] t   think   anyone   can   deny   it   is   a   beautifully   made   and   well   written   movie .
853925151	11337	2.0	a   lot   better   than   a   lot   of   movies   now   in   this   specific   genre   are .    but   i ['] m   so   bored   with   this   shit   i   probably   couldn ['] t   stand   to   watch   it   again .
853925151	7032	4.0	see   i   don ['] t   understand   why   someone   who   can   put   out   great   comedies   like   this   go   on   to   make   bs   like   the   love   guru .
853925151	758	3.0	actually   pretty   funny .    i   believe   tina   fey   produced   this   and   wrote   it ?    it   definitely   would   have   been   pretty   fucking   stupid   without   her   feeding   the   lines   to   that   talentless   moron   lohan .
853925151	12471	2.0	eminem   was   very   surprising   in   this .
853925151	3579	1.5	qiut   making   shitty   suequels   hollywood .    tokyo   drift   was   good   though .

598147846	1703	3.0	i ['] m   a   huge   fan   of   drew   barrymore ,    so   i   have   to   like   this    -    even   if   her   accent   was   beyond   awful .
598147846	16082	3.0	this   was   kind   of   fluffy   and   cute .
598147846	14691	2.0	i   would   have   liked   this   a   lot   more   without   keanu   reeves .
598147846	7499	2.5	jeff   goldblum   and   will   smith   are   the   only   things   that   save   this   film   from   being   a   total   disaster .
598147846	15107	1.0	just   didn ['] t   grab   me .
598147846	11283	3.0	a   little   over - hyped   in   my   opinion .    not   bad ,    though .
598147846	5154	2.0	this   could   have   been   so   much   better   without   reeves .
598147846	16969	3.0	i   don ['] t   get   all   the   hype   about   this   one .    it   was   thoroughly   average .
598147846	7040	4.0	the   animal   characters   are   what   makes   this   film   so   great .
598147846	4956	2.0	another   case   of   the   sequels   not   living   up   to   the   originals .
598147846	17479	1.5	this   could   have   been   great    -    the   japanese   version   it ['] s   based   on   is   fantastic .    but   they   really   lost   something   in   the   remake .
598147846	1625	3.0	i   saw   this   once   years   and   years   ago ,    and   vaguely   remember   enjoying   it .    everyone   keeps   telling   me   it   was   the   worst   installment ,    though .
598147846	14538	1.5	it   was   cute ,    but   not   really   to   my   taste .
598147846	3713	0.5	i   love   horror   movies ,    but   this   just   sucked .
598147846	11398	5.0	i   love   this   film .
598147846	758	3.0	i   actually   think   this   film   is   pretty   cute .
598147846	2395	3.5	i   like   comedy   horror   and   flicks   that   don ['] t   take   themselves   too   seriously .
598147846	3925	1.0	all   of   the   matrix   movies   would   have   been   improved   if   keanu   reeves   hadn ['] t   been   in   them .

154624426	15205	4.0	good .       one   of   those   movies   that   makes   you   feel   numb   at   the   end .

154624426	12471	4.0	eminem   did   a   good   job   in   this   one .       much   better   actor   than   50   cent .

497280691	17479	2.0	this   movie   isnt   bad .  .  .    it   was   a   great   horror   movie ,    but   the   truth   is ,    i   just   dont   like   horor   movies   in   general .  . im   a   wuss

801408806	686	4.0	i   really   thoght   this   movie   was   hilarious .
801408806	6196	0.5	i   dont   like   these   movies .
801408806	7048	0.5	this   movie   is   dumb   for   me
801408806	5223	5.0	great   movie ,    but   i   would   like   for   it   to   explain   some   more   stuff   that   happened   to   the   people .    i   might   even   read   the   book   now .
801408806	8928	3.0	i   thought   that   it   could   be   better .
801408806	3533	5.0	this   is   awesomer   than   awesomest .    it   freaking   cracks   me   up   every   time   that   i   watch   this .    some   of   the   analogies   are   weird   but ,    they   makes   sense .    this   movie   is   a   must   watch   if   you ['] re   into   comedy   and   politics   but ,    mainly   comedy .    although   there   are   some   awkward   parts ,    it ['] s   still   one   of   my   favorites .     =  ]     * rawr *
801408806	5607	5.0	this   was   a   sad   movie   but   i   liked   it .
801408806	3689	1.0	i   thought   it   wasnt   that   scary .

801408806	6030	4.5	this   is   a   truely   wonderful   movie
801408806	14042	5.0	this   movie   is   very   confusing ,    sad , and   really   enjoyable .    this   movie   should   really   be   seen   because   of   the   plotline   and   how   the   characters   interact   with   each   other .    this   could   be   my    # 1   fav .    movie .
801408806	10314	0.5	i   didnt   like   it
801408806	758	5.0	i   finally   got   to   see   it   and   it   was   interesting   how   times   have   changed    .       just   a   few   years   change   the   images   of   everyone   out   there .
801408806	8160	3.0	it   wasnt   that   great
801408806	10835	5.0	this   movie   is   really   weird   but   i   love   it
801408806	16113	5.0	this   always   makes   me   laugh   with   its   randomness .
801408806	4506	5.0	i   changed   my   mind   of   this   movie .    this   movie   is   like   a   sappy ,    chick - flick ,    comedy   with   a   twist   that   is   just   waiting   to   be   viewed .    i   loved   this   movie   a   lot   becasue   it   shows   how   greed   of   money   turns   out   for   a   chick .    she   bluntly   states   that   she   wants   a   man   that   is   a   millionaire   but   then   she ['] s   faced   with   a   non - famous   writer   who   actually   loves   her   for   whom   she   is ,    but   she   is   blinded   by   the   money .    i   really   think   that   this   movie   is   pretty   good   to   watch   when   you ['] re   bored   because   it   brings   out   different   emotions   out .
801408806	8301	0.5	i   didnt   like   it   much
801408806	3905	4.0	very   interesting   plotline
801408806	5667	0.5	i   like   the   old   mask   movie   better .
801408806	11999	3.5	very   dumb   but   in   a   funny   way
801408806	12238	0.5	this   was   a   movie   that   i   realy   didnt   like
801408806	11702	0.5	i   saw   most   of   it   but   i   really   didnt   like   it .
801408806	1324	5.0	a   very   beautiful   movie
801408806	7989	4.5	if   i   had   to   choose   this   would   be   my   favorite   princess   movie
801408806	10282	1.0	that ['] s   wat   my   family   nicknamed   me .
801408806	11218	0.5	i   really   didn ['] t   like   it .
782020817	2985	4.0	a   very   funny   movie ,    with   wacky   off - beat   humor ,    and   a   tendancy   to   push   the   envelope   of   what   is   in   poor   taste .       but   very   funny .
782020817	14691	5.0	one   of   the   best   sci - fi   films   since    " star   wars "  ,    as   far   as   the   freshness   of   it .       very   creative ,    and   stylishly   told .       the   motion   techniques   this   introduced   were   great   at   the   time ,    but   now   have   been   copied   by   everyone .       it ['] s   not   so   exciting   anymore ,    but   the   original   movie   is   great .
782020817	10042	5.0	another   one   of   the   movies   that   made   me   love   movies   so   much .       we   owe   a   lot   to   mr .    spielberg   and   mr .    lucas .
782020817	15107	4.5	quite   entertaining ,    and   much   better   than   the   original   starring   the   rat   pack
782020817	1905	5.0	a   great   pirate   movie .
782020817	14822	4.0	surpisingly   good .       a   movie   that   worthy   of   disney ,    but   made   by   20th   century   fox .
782020817	3938	3.5	i   loved   the   original ,    but   this   one   left   something   to   be   desired .       still   funny ,    but   i   think   it   could   have   been   a   lot   better .
782020817	4472	4.5	this   one   snuck   up   on   me .       i   liked   it   the   first   time   i   saw ,    but   now   have   grown   to   love   it .       it   was   number   four   on   my   all   time   top   10   holiday   films .
782020817	7521	3.0	surprisingly   funny ,    but   there   aren ['] t   quite   enough   good   moments   to   recommend   it   highly .
782020817	15063	1.0	hated   it !
782020817	6206	4.0	a   surprisingly   funny   movie ,    that   got   over - exposure   once   it   became   a   hit .       still ,    it ['] s   quite   good .
782020817	10928	3.0	one   of   jim   carrey ['] s   first   outings   that   is   funny ,    but   i   can   only   take   so   much   of   jim   carrey   when   he   is   in   obnoxious   mode .       i   like   many   of   his   films ,    and   this   isn ['] t   bad ,    but   it   isn ['] t   my   favorite   either .       i   prefer    " dumb   and   dumber "  ,    or    " bruce   almighty "
782020817	8072	5.0	definitely   one   of   the   best   roles   brad   pitt   has   ever   played ,    and   morgan   freeman   is   solid   as   usual .       put   david   fincher   on   my   directors   to   watch   list .
782020817	17479	3.5	surprisingly   scary   and   well   done   thriller   remake   of   a   japanese   film   called    " ringu "  .       unfortunately   the   sequel   did   not   live   up   to   the   first   one .
782020817	13610	3.5	i   liked   the   movie   but   had   some   problems   with   the   special   effects .       they   just   don ['] t   look   that   good   to   me .       spidey   is   a   little   to   robotic ,    and   the   green   screen   work   in   this   one   left   a   lot   to   be   desired .       i   think   the   spidey   effects   got   better   in   the   sequels .       i   also   didn ['] t   like   the   way   his   relationship   with   uncle   ben   was   portrayed .
782020817	10583	4.0	surprisingly   sweet ,    and   entertaining .       this   is   where   i   really   started   to   like   jack   black .       he   is   good   in    " the   holiday "    as   well ,    and    " orange   county "
782020817	2457	3.0	a   decent   teenage   version   of   cinderella
782020817	3962	5.0	disney   classic .
782020817	16604	4.0	not   my   favorite   clint   eastwood   film ,    but   quite   good .
782020817	2463	5.0	disney   classic .       one   of   my   favorites .       i   would   love   to   see   a   sequel .
782020817	7664	4.5	a   great   and   oscar   worth   performance   by   russell   crowe ,    even   though   he   probably   deserved   and   oscar   for   either    " the   insider "  ,    or    " cinderella   man "    more .
782020817	17324	4.0	i   like   will   smith ,    and   i   found    " hitch "    to   be   quite   entertaining .       eva   mendes   is   easy   on   the   eyes   as   well   as   giving   a   nice   performance .
782020817	2660	4.5	the   first   time   i   saw   this   i   was   practically   dieing   with   the   stomach   flu ,    but   i   still   found   myself   enjoying   the   moive .       it   is   a   great   movie .
782020817	17622	4.5	i   think   i   was   in   the   minority   on   this   one .       i   liked   it   quite   a   bit .       i   haven ['] t   met   a   cameron   crowe   film   that   i   haven ['] t   liked ,    and   that   includes    " elizabethtown "
782020817	11337	4.0	the   current   generation ['] s    " porky ['] s "    or    " animal   house "  .       starts   out   as   a   raunch   fest ,    but   feels   a   little   bit   like   an    " afterschool   special "    by   the   time   its   over .       a   teen   sex   comedy   with   a   heart .
782020817	5239	1.5	a   terrible   remake   of   a   cult   classic .
782020817	4698	2.5	i   was   really   disappointed   with   this   one .       when   spielberg   suddenly   turned   the   movie   into   a   godzilla   moive   at   the   end   that   was   it   for   me .       i   expected   a   lot   more ,    after   seeing   the   classic    " jurassic   park "  .       the   main   characters   had   way   too   easy   a   time   of   surviving   compared   to   the   unlucky   extras .
782020817	7057	4.5	the   fellowship   of   the   rings   is   better ,    but   this   one   is   quite   good   as   well .
782020817	12471	3.0	eminem   is   surprisingly   good ,    but   the   script   could   have   been   better
782020817	30	4.5	this   is   a   very   funny   movie ,    and   i   think   very   true   to   life .
782020817	1962	3.5	another   funny ,    sweet ,    but   twisted   comedy   from   adam   sandler .       i   liked   the   chemistry   between   sandler   and   barrymore .
782020817	1255	4.0	this   is   a   funny   movie .       if   you   like   this ,    check   out   the   other   films   by   savage   steve   holland .        " one   crazy   summer "    with   cusack   again   doesn ['] t   quite   measure   up   to   this   one .        " how   i   got   into   college "    is   quite   funny   as   well .
782020817	11077	3.5	not   as   good   as    " meet   the   parents "  ,    but   still   very   entertaining .       can ['] t   wait   for    " meet   the   little   focker "
782020817	15205	2.5	not   very   realistic ,    but   somewhat   entertaining   portrayal   of   what   would   happen   if   another   ice   age   came   over   night ,    or   the   day   after   tomorrow .
782020817	8989	3.5	surprisingly   good   movie .       julia   stiles
782020817	1542	4.5	the   best   of   the   hanks / ryan   movies .       if   you   haven ['] t   seen   joe   vs .    the   volcano    ( meg   ryan   plays   three   roles )  ,    you   should .
782020817	3320	4.5	love   it .
782020817	6235	4.0	i   really   like   this   movie   because   the   kis   in   this   film   aren ['] t   just   brats .       you   seem   them   actually   mature   from   teenagers   to   young   adults .
782020817	5571	5.0	love   it .       a   classic .       even   though   most   of   the   time   i   can ['] t   stand   stallone   now .        " rocky   balboa "  ,    otherwise   known   as    " rocky   6 "    was   a   pleasant   surprise ,    though .
782020817	16879	5.0	i   know   this   one   got   played   to   death ,    but   after   seeing   it   several   times   i   think   it   still   holds   up   very   well .
782020817	4356	4.5	this   is   an   excellent   film .       i   really   enjoyed   seeing   tom   hanks   as   a   good   guy   who   just   happens   to   be   in   a   bad   guy   profession .
782020817	6287	4.0	i   probably   shouldn ['] t   like   this   movie   as   much   as   i   do .       julia   roberts   is   quite   good   in   the   lead   role ,    and   hector   ellizondo   has   a   nice   performance    ( as   he   does   in   almost   every   gary   marshall   film )
782020817	7032	3.5	the   least   of   the   austin   powers   filsm ,    but   still   pretty   good .
782020817	3860	4.0	i   enjoyed   jim   carrey   in   this   because   he   isn ['] t   quite   so   over   the   top .       it   seems   like   a   role   jimmy   stewart   might   have   played .       love   morgan   freeman   as   god .
782020817	11781	4.0	not   as   good   as    " raiders .  .  "  ,    but   still   quite   entertaining .       i   love   kate   capshaw    ( lucky   mr .    spielberg )
782020817	5991	4.0	very   dark ,    but   entertaining .
780722095	2985	3.5	the   diaz   makes   this   movie   hot .  .  . need   i   say   any   more ?
780722095	14691	4.5	love   this   movie !
780722095	1905	4.0	this   was   a   great   film   i ['] m   almost   surprised   that   disney   could   actually   make   a   great   live   action   film .  .  . when   walt   disney   died .  .  .    so   did   live   action ,    but   it   seems   to   be   coming   back !

780722095	11077	3.0	again   i   prefer   the   1st   movie ,    but   this   movie   did   keep   me   interested   through   out .

780722095	16879	3.5	it ['] s   alright ,    but   i   think   i   feel   that   way   cause   i   only   saw   it   once .  .  . there   was   good   production ,    but   that   dosn ['] t   make   me   a   chick   flick   fan .

790647994	12092	0.5	i   think   all   the   actors   involved   in   this   movie   would   like   to   erase   from   their   memory   and   their   resumes .

790647994	10832	3.5	this   movie   freaked   me   out   more   than   any   other   horror   movie .       that   music   from   the   shower   scene   raises   the   hairs   on   the   back   of   my   neck .

790647994	3609	4.0	" this   stuff   will   make   you   a   god   damned   sexual   tyrannosaurus ,    just   like   me "  .       that   has   got   to   be   one   of   the   best   movie   lines      ever .       i   spent   half   of   this   movie   with   my   head   under   my   jacket .
790647994	3254	3.5	i   enjoyed   this ,    but   then ,    daredevil   was   never      comic   i   collected .
790647994	2780	4.0	an   excellent   sci - fi   movie .
790647994	2782	2.5	would   have   gotten   a   higher   star   if   he   lived   at   the   end .  .  .    or   at   least   if   the   death   scene   was   implied .       it   ruined   the   movie   for   me .
790647994	11745	3.0	it   was   okay .       i   like   electra   in   the   comic   books   and   i   thought   jennifer   garner   was   a   good   choice .       however ,    the   material   was   weak   i   thought .
790647994	4432	3.5	who   doesn ['] t   like   a   good   heist   movie ?
790647994	9442	4.5	i   love   this   movie !       so   many   awesome   lines ,    especially   riddick ['] s   comment   about   tombs [']     " skittish "    crew .       lol .       i   have   a   thing   for   flawed   heros .  .  .    anti - heros .       makes   for   a   more   interesting   story .
790647994	14482	3.5	interesting   sci - fi .       not   a   movie   to   see   when   there   are   a   lot   of   distractions .
790647994	15582	3.5	i   must   like   reese   witherspoon   because   i   seem   to   like   all   her   romantic   comedies .
790647994	14198	4.0	good   movie   for   film   students   to   study .       nice   portrayal   of   an   anti - hero .
790647994	16969	4.0	cool   movie .
790647994	5939	3.5	not   nearly   as   good   as   the   first .
790647994	494	3.0	i ['] m   a   monty   python   fan .    what   can   i   say ?        " always   look   on   the   bright   side   of   life .  .  .    do   do ,    do   do   do   do .  .  .  "
790647994	16879	1.0	i   just   could   not   see   what   people   liked   about   this   movie .       i   really   wanted   to   hurl   and   some   of   it   made   me   laugh .       i ['] m   just   not   wired   for   romance   movies   i   guess .          although   i   do   like   some .  .  .
790647994	3864	4.5	christian   bale   is   brilliant   in   this   role .       probably   the   best   of   the   comic   book   movies .       as   a   comic   book   fan   i   appreciate   that   nolan   took   the   material   serious   and   didn ['] t   turn   it   into   a   joke   like   schumacher .
790647994	16242	3.5	now   here ['] s   a   guility   pleasure .       i   really   enjoyed   this   movie .

790647994	14312	4.0	saw   this   in   the   theatres   and   still   remember   the   chill   of   the    ['] boom [']    of   the   tyranasaurus   rex   walking   and   the   ripple   of   water   in   the   glass .

790647994	8851	4.0	a   surprisenly   excellent   movie .
790647994	4545	4.0	probably   the   best   kevin   costner   movie .       silverado   rocked   though .  .  .    you   should   check   it   out   if   you ['] ve   never   seen   it .

23285361	7828	5.0	for   some   reason   i   actually   loved   this   film . this   movie   gives   a   sexy ,    sensual   twist   to   the   stereotypical    " teen   flick .  "    it   communicates   a   new   idea   of   sexuality   amongst   present - day   teenagers ,    rather   than   the    " bang   her   and   leave   her "    mentality   that   is   most   commonly   portrayed .    i   think   the   cast   was   very   well   chosen ,    and   the   dynamics   of   the   cast   were   amazing .    there   weren ['] t   too   many    " no   names "    or    " b   list "    actors ,    but   on   the   other   hand   there   weren ['] t   too   many    " a   listers ,  "    which   would   have   thrown   the   focus   off   the   plot .    the   music   used   in   the   movie   was   perfect   because   it   accentuated   the   tone   of   the   movie . i   think   cruel   intentions   is   one   of   the   best   films   which   has   repersented   teen   life   and   it   is   well   worth   watching .

23285361	14198	5.0	an   extremely   competent   look   at   the   scottish   drug - scene ,    trainspotting   is   a   perfect   example   of   the   potential   of   the   uk   industry   to   tell   a   story   of   tragedy ,    horror   and   hope   in   a   manner   that   the   american   industry   has   yet   to   do   without   drifting   into   tired   cliche .    while   the   manner   and   style   of   delivery   are   extremely   funny   and   at   times   appear   almost   unreal ,    the   fact   remains   that   these   characters   are   real .    the   clearly   psychotic   and   alcoholic   begbie ,    played   by   robert   carlyle   is   a   supporting   role   that   is   actually   of   immense   value   to   the   film .    here   we   have   character   who   i ['] ve   met ,    you ['] ve   met   and   we ['] ve   all   met .    a   man   with   very   little   to   lose   absorbed   in   a   sea   of   alcohol   and   prone   to   violence .    i   choose   him   as   example   because   he   isnt   even   involved   in   the   drug - scene   in   which   the   main   characters   are   central .    in   fact   his   opposition   is   somewhat   humorous   when   we   consider   his   own   vices   make   him   argueably   worse   off   and   the   incidences   of   violence   he   becomes   involved   inare   most   definitely   black   humour .    considering   what   is   actually   happening   isnt   funny ,    watching   it   play   out ,    aside   from   one   major   incident ,    is   extremely   funny .    and   that   is   the   tone   of   the   film   throughout ,    as   characters   continually   talk   nonsence   and   sail   through   the   lives   they   have   chosen ,    making   very   little   progress ,    but   instead   drifting   downwards   until   an   opportunity   presents   itself   to   change   their   ways ,    where   upon   renton ,    ewan   mcgregor ,    must   make   a   choice   between   his   own   life   or   his   friends .    mcgregor   himself   is   excellent   in   the   film   that   made   him ,    as   is   jonny   lee   miller ,    who   surprised   me   in   this   film   by   having   a   more   thought - provoking   character   than   the   script   and   time   strictly   allowed   considering   his   relatively   minimal   place   in   the   main   storyline .    ewen   bremner   provided   some   excellent   and   often   well - needed   comic   relief   and   carlyle   as   i   mentioned ,    was   outstanding .    this   film   is   both   real   and   unreal ,    taking   the   humour   of    " human   traffic "    and   the   somber   tone   of    " my   name   is   joe "    and   blending   them   together   to   create   an   unforgettable   experience   vividly   accompanied   by   strains   of    " perfect   day "    and   other   cultural   and   nostalgic   sounds ,    particularly   of   the   place   and   period .    trainspotting   has   been   accused   of   glamourising   drug - use   but   i   firmly   believe   anyone   who   takes   this   view   hasnt   watched   it   properly .    the   fun   is   equally ,    if   not   more   so ,    matched   by   some   nasty   images   and   for   the   time   it   was   released ,    provided   what   was   a   very   necessary   look   at   the   growing   drug   industry ,    the   loss   it   creates   and   the   hope   that   can   arise .    superb .

771357202	14691	4.0	a   modern   classic ,    redefining   cgi   in   films   as   we   know   it .
771357202	2985	2.5	only   thing   i   can   remember   of   it   is   the    " hair   gel "    now .
771357202	3463	0.5	nah .
771357202	11077	2.0	ok   i   guess
771357202	9593	4.5	its   friday .  .  .    we   gonna   get   high    :  )

771357202	1905	5.0	fantastic   film .    johnny   depp   makes   it .    savvy    : d
771357202	7521	4.0	great   film .    when   it   came   out   it   was   my   knida   humour .
771357202	16969	5.0	fantastic   film .    total   mind - messer .
771357202	3320	4.5	i   really   like   this   film ,    which   is   strange   considering   the   fact   that   im   not   one   for   hugh   grant   films    ( 4w & af ,    bridget   1 + 2   etc .  )
771357202	12605	5.0	possibly   one   of   the   best   of   all   time
771357202	17479	0.5	its   unfortunately   a   very   poor   hollywood   conversion   of   a   classic   japanese   horror   film .    and   they   had   the   audacity   to   do   it   again   with   the   ring   2 .    i   just   hope   they   don ['] t   remake   ring   0 .    it   epitomises   everything   i   hate   about   hollywood   horror   films .    i   would   give   it   a   0   but   dont   think   you   can .
771357202	13610	3.0	good ,    getting   better   as   the   series   goes   along .    looking   forward   to   no .    3 !
771357202	10583	4.0	great   film .    although   pod   is   definitely   jb ['] s   best   film    ( with   orange   county   about    . 01 %    behind )
771357202	17324	2.0	bearable ,    but   only   as   will   smith   keeps   growing   on   me .    i   like   the   guy   but   cant   put   my   finger   on   why    ( other   than   fresh   prince    : d )
771357202	5571	5.0	a   true   classic .    what   more   can   i   say ?    except .  .  .  .    yo   adrien !
771357202	7032	2.5	true   brit   power ( s )     : d
771357202	5239	3.5	well   ive   got   it   on   dvd   but   its   not   one   i   watch   all   the   time   anymore ,    but   good   nonetheless .
771357202	3860	3.0	interesting   idea   but   think   they   couldve   done   better   than   jim   carrey .    dont   rate   him   as   an   actor    ( although   i   havent   yet   seen   eternal   sunshine )
771357202	13471	3.0	its   just   not   smith ['] s   legendary   jersey   films   we   love .    good   in   a   way   but   not   what   i   want   from   the   man   who   gave   us   some   of   the   greatest   slackers   of   all   time !     ( ooh ,    that   reminds   me .  .  .    slacker !  )
771357202	5991	5.0	i   love   the   concept ,    the   storyline ,    the   acting ,    the   effects .  .  .    everything !
771357202	12471	4.0	i   actually   like   this   film .    strange   considering   the   kind   of   things   its   predominantly   about    ( rap   music ,    something   im   not   a   huge   fan   of )  .    but   it   just   goes   to   show   that   eminem   is   a   talented   actor   and   hats   off   to   him .    his   performance   kinda   saw   him   through .    the   fact   that   it   was   based   on   his   own   life   though   does   help   that   though .
771357202	3579	2.5	fast   cars .    thatll   get   my   attention .    but   i   think   the   first   one   was   better .
771357202	1962	3.5	well   handled   take   on   love ,    relationships ,    comedy   and   general   happy   madison   productions   randomness    ( although   give   me   mr   deeds   all   the   way !  )

783791465	10583	3.0	i   was   expecting   more   from   jack   black   in   this   1    ,    but   i   guess   he   cant   be   that   funny   all   the   time
783791465	3962	2.5	it   was   ok    ,    i   probibly   wouldent   watch   it   willingly    ,    but   if   it   was   the   only   movie   i   owned   i   would   rather   watch   it   then   stare   at   a   blank   page

783791465	12471	4.0	this   is   a   good   insight   to   a   very   tallented   mans   life    ,    to   think   he   went   through   all   this   shit   is   sad    ,    but   its   made   him   a   stronger   person   in   my   opinion
153556535	2372	4.0	one   of   those   rare   sequels   that   realizes   why   the   first   one   was   good   and   builds   on   it   while   introducing   new   characters   and   giving   older   characters   more   screen   time   and   a   bigger   role .    oh   and   the   hand   to   hand   fighting   is   still   amazing .
153556535	6434	4.0	awesome   movie .       don ['] t   judge   it   by   the   cover ,    give   it   a   chance .
153556535	10042	4.0	the   character   of   indy   is   really   cool   but   the   movie   is   a   typical   adventure   type

153556535	5696	4.5	very   good   for   the   simple   fact   that   they   didn ['] t   have   to   blast   a   thousand   aliens   to   make   a   good   alien   movie
153556535	17330	5.0	i   know   it   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   book   but   it ['] s   still   awesome   and   i   love   it
153556535	15952	4.5	i   love   football   movies   even   the   stupid   funny   ones

153556535	14507	4.0	good   movie ,    but   not   the   best   football   film   i ['] ve   seen
153556535	14209	4.5	one   of   the   absolute   coolest   characters   to   ever   be   in   a   movie .       riddick   is   the   reason   why   this   film   works .       i   first   watched   this   film   in   5th   grade   and   i   loved   the   bloody   action   like   any   other   5th   grade .       yet   today   i   can   still   watch   this   film   and   find   great   things   in   it .       the   positives   the   plot   is   simple   but   who   cares ?       many   sci - fi   flicks   tend   to   get   so   big   and   massive   that   the   plot   becomes   confusing ,    lame ,    and   redundant .       i   loved   how   the   director / writer   had   a   story   that ['] s   been   done   before ,    yet   he   was   able   to   add   simple   things   such   as   a   varied   list   of   characters   to   truly   make   this   feel   original .       that   brings   me   to   another   positive ,    the   characters .       there   are   many   different   characters   and   the   film   isn ['] t   afraid   to   kill   off   many   of   them .       in   most   movies ,    you   can   predict   who   survives   just   by   watching   the   trailer .       that   isn ['] t   the   case   here ,    they   kill   mercilessly   and   unpredicably .       the   biggest   reason   i   love   this   film   is   the   riddick   himself .       he ['] s   the   ultimate   tough   guy ,    convict ,    and   anti - hero .       you   never   quite   know   if   he ['] s   a   good   guy   or   bad   guy   and   vin   diesel   is   perfect   as   him .             the   negatives   my   one   complaint   would   all   the   effects   and   shades   used   in   this   film .       in   one   scene ,    you   get   a   dark   blue   tint ,    and   the   next   is   a   very   bright   view   of   the   sun .       it   actually   hurts   your   eyes   to   look   at   it   for   too   long .       i   know   this   and   the   effects   are   mostly   due   to   the   budget   so   i   can ['] t   punish   this   movie   too   much .       they   did   the   best   with   what   they   had .       pitch   black   is   a   relatively   low - budget   sci - fi   flick   that   could ['] ve   fallen   to   cliches   suffered   from   past   flicks   yet   with   a   clever   writer / director ,    it   turns   out   to   be   an   awesome   sci - fi   flick   with   the   coolest   character   ever ,    riddick !  !  !
153556535	13501	3.5	good   movie   with   a   shocking   death   in   the   beginning
153556535	4753	3.0	extremely   bloody   and   gross   with   a   realistic   ending
153556535	17560	5.0	classic   film .       one   of   my   all   time   favorites .       i   loved   this   film   as   a   kid   and   it   still   holds   up   today .       with   the   possibility   of   a   third   film   and   the   video   game   coming   out ,    i   had   to   dig   out   my   vhs   copy   of   ghostbusters    ( i   really   need   to   get   the   dvds )       ghostbusters [']    cast   could   not   have   been   better .       bill   murray   and   dan   aykroyd   are   hilarious   together   and   sigourney   weaver   was   great   as   the   sexy   love   interest .       even   harold   ramis ,    rick   moranis ,    and   ernie   hudson   all   get   their   shares   of   the   laughs   as   well .       the   comedy   is   great   but   ghostbusters   is   so   much   more .       the   action   is   exciting   and   there   are   parts   that   terrified   me   as   a   child .       the   effects   are   tremendous   for   an   80s   movie .       i   can ['] t   see   a   reason   not   to   love   this   film .       it   truly   stands   the   test   of   time   as   an   entertaining   comedy / action / scary   movie .
153556535	1585	3.0	better   than   most   thrillers   but   nothing   great
153556535	12494	4.0	who   knew   owen   wilson   could   do   something   other   than   comedy ?       i   was   certainly   surprised   to   see   him   playing   a   navy   navigator   in   behind   enemy   lines .       he   does   do   a   good   job   playing   the   disobedient   pilot .       behind   enemy   lines   can   be   summed   up   by   the   title .       basicly   a   jet   gets   shot   down   and   they ['] re   behind   enemy   lines .       the   u . s .    isn ['] t   allowed   to   help   due   to   nato   rules   so   owen   wilson   and   his   pilot   have   to   get   to   safety .       what   really   shocked   me   about   this   film   is   the   plot   isn ['] t   predictable .       just   from   the   synopsis ,    i   assumed   it ['] d   be   owen   wilson   courageously   getting   to   safety   and   flying   home .       well   there ['] s   a   lot   more   to   this   film   than   just   that .       i   won ['] t   give   anything   away   but   it   is   good .       behind   enemy   lines   is   an   intense ,    exciting ,    and   heroic   film   of   war   and   survival .       so   if   you   find   this   film   in   the   five   dollar   bin   at   wal - mart ,    i   recommend   giving   it   a   try .

253224316	9254	5.0	excellent !    nothing   else   could   possibly   describe   how   good   this   film   is !
253224316	6552	4.5	this   is   a   great   film !    might   not   be   everyone ['] s   thing   though !
253224316	299	3.5	not   bad .    has   some   funny   moments .    not   sure   it ['] s   something   i   would   go   back   to   a   lot .
253224316	11710	3.0	it ['] s   not   terrible ,    but   not   really   worth   more   than   one   watch .    has   it   good   moments   though ,    so   don ['] t   totally   dismiss   it !
253224316	15078	4.0	i   really   enjoy   this   film ,    but   i   feel   there   is   something   missing ,    not   sure   what   though !    which   is   why   only   4 *  .
253224316	3579	1.0	first   was   alright ,    this   was   much   of   the   same   but   without   the   storyline !  !

253224316	9509	4.5	this   is   one   of   those   films   i   remember   loving   as   a   child   again ,    so   it   gets   a   high   rating !  !
253224316	10466	5.0	yet   another   classic   disney !    enough   said !
253224316	7828	5.0	brilliantly    ['] cruel [']    and   twisted   film .    great   story   with   some   very   emotional   moments !

253224316	3463	4.0	i   enjoyed   this   film .    not   sure   if   i   would   wanna   put   it   in   my   top   films ,    but   it ['] s   still   a   good   teen   movie !  !
253224316	11176	4.0	another   classic   film   from   my   childhood .    who   else   wants   to   ride   an   ant   now ?    ok ,    it ['] s   dated   but   still   good !
253224316	10928	1.0	ok ,    has   a   few   funny   moments ,    i   am   not   a   great   jim   carrey   fan .
253224316	6859	3.0	this   was   funny   enough ,    with   some   stand   out   moments !  !    i   would   say   worth   a   watch !
253224316	13673	5.0	great   film .     ['] to   infinity   and   beyond [']    gotta   love   the   alien   dudes   too !

253224316	17560	5.0	sorry ,    has   to   be   done .  .  .     ['] who   ya   gonna   call ?  [']
253224316	12014	4.5	creepy ,    with   a   easy   storyline ,    which   is   what   you   need   for   a   horror !
253224316	11149	3.0	good   film ,    with   a   good   performance   from   j - lo .    worth   a   watch   every   now   and   then .
253224316	3254	2.0	only   gets   2 *    because   i   think   garner   is   great .    think   affleck   is   terrible !  !    shame ,    could ['] ve   been   good !
253224316	8989	5.0	great   story   and   brilliant   dancing   in   that   club !  !       i ['] m   learning .  .  .
253224316	8108	4.0	another   great   pixar ,    but   not   quite   as   good   as   the   incredibles   and   toy   story !
253224316	14725	5.0	this   was   my   favourite   of   all   three   movies .    hence   the   5 *  !
253224316	2528	5.0	this   gets   five   for   the   sheer   fact   that   the   memories   of   it   scare   me   enough !  !    all   those   eyes .  .  .  .    ewwww !
253224316	10421	3.0	another   funny   enough   spoof   in   this   series .    a   good   film   if   you   need   a   bit   of   light   entertainment   without   too   much   effort !    not   as   good   as   first   two   though !
253224316	4171	1.0	this   movie   is   worth   a   slight   smile   the   first   time   rond ,    but   begins   to   grate   very   quickly ,    and   you   can ['] t   wish   the   credits   soon   enough !  !
253224316	5939	4.5	i   love   the   comedy   side   to   these   films .    well   balanced   with   other   elements   of   the   film .
253224316	12546	3.0	funny   enough   in   its   day !    i   think   culkin   can   get   a   little   irritating   at   times   throughout   this   film .    but   still ,    not   too   bad !
253224316	3713	4.5	excellent   film .    brilliant   twists .    second   is   better   though   as   acting   in   this   one   can   sometimes   be   a   bit   poor ,    but   that   doesn ['] t   take   from   the   film   too   much .
253224316	12244	0.5	film   was   not   at   all   interesting .  .  .  .    but   nice   to   see   jennifer   aniston   take   on   a   different   role   and   make   it   work !
253224316	16879	3.0	it   wasn ['] t   too   bad .  .  .    a   bit   predictable .  .  .  .  . hehe   don ['] t   think   i   would   watch   it   again !
253224316	13102	5.0	not   sure   about   making   me   want   to   jump   on   a   table   and   throw   water   on   myself ,    but   it ['] s   an   excellent   film   all   the   same !  !
253224316	607	4.5	brilliant .    don ['] t   bother   with   the   second   one   though !
253224316	17482	4.0	a   good   funny   teen   comedy .
253224316	14691	4.5	c ['] mon ,    it ['] s   the   matrix !
253224316	3161	4.5	one   of   my   favs   from   the   scary   movie   collection    ( having   not   watched   sc4   though )  .    very   funny   and   good   spoofing   of   horrors !
253224316	11283	5.0	i   love   this   film .    tom   hanks   has   shown   he   is   great   at   carrying   a   movie   all   by   himself !  !

253224316	12785	5.0	loved   this   film ,    created   a   great   setting   for   what   will   hopefully   be   a   brilliant   trilogy !  !

253224316	940	4.0	this   is   good ,    not   sure   if   it ['] s   a   disney   i   would   watch   a   great   deal .    but   i   do   like   the   singing    ['] vase [']    ladies ,    very   lol .
253224316	3962	4.0	good   film ,    i   am   a   massive   disney   fan ,    but   i   felt   it   could ['] ve   been   better !

253224316	10820	4.5	i   like   these   films ,    maybe   it ['] s   the   whole   idea   of   time   travel !  !

253224316	6972	2.5	i   used   to   like   this   film ,    but   i   feel   it ['] s   a   bit   too   long   and   not   worth   watching   too   many   times !
253224316	7511	4.5	great   films ,    really   worth   watching   if   you ['] re   into   the   whole   vampire   thing !

253224316	1518	3.5	well ,    he ['] s   a   friendly   ghost   and   the   story   is   quite   well   thought   out !    worth   a   watch !
253224316	3920	4.5	i   really   enjoyed   this   film ,    as   it   was   out   during   the   come - back   season   of   slasher   movies !  !
253224316	9882	5.0	this   film   is   just   brilliant .    chris   tucker   is   hilarious .    and   strong   cast   throughout !

253224316	9415	0.5	yep ,    it   really   is   that   poor !    not   funny   and   has   a   really   irritating   car    ['] air   freshner [']    that   talks !  !
253224316	1703	3.0	good   film .    worthy   of   a   one   off   watch !  !    drew   plays   her   part   excellently !
253224316	9685	2.5	have   to   say   from   what   i   remember   i   found   this   film   a   little   too   slow .    i   watched   a   while   back   and   don ['] t   remember   it   all   that   well !
253224316	15110	4.5	i   prefer   this   one   slightly   to   the   first .    can ['] t   wait   for   the   third   instalment !

253224316	13195	4.0	these   were   more   like   a    ['] fad [']  .    but   it   passed   and   so   did   all   the   catchphrases !     ['] yeah ,    baby ,    yeah !     ['] mojo [']  !       hehe
253224316	11337	4.0	good   film ,    but   not   a   great   deal   of   lol   moments !
253224316	753	5.0	i   like   this   film ,    makes   ya   feel   good .       could   be   all   that   over   the   top   chirpy   feel   good   music !
253224316	12471	0.5	not   my   kinda   film ,    but   it   is   quite   insightful   into   his   life !
253224316	3079	5.0	as   expected   from   disney .  .  .    great !  !
253224316	6068	4.0	funny   enough .    but   credit   has   to   go   to   the   catchy   theme   tune .  .  .
253224316	14050	4.5	a   bit   of   a   classic   really .    a   few   moments   that   i   am   not   so   fond   of .    but   still   a   great   film !
253224316	5793	5.0	this   was   great .    made   a   change   from   the   normal   vampire   movies   you   get !  !    kate   beckinsale   is   just   great   in   this   movie !
253224316	2412	5.0	love   the   magical   aspects   of   these   films .    a   very   easy   and   enjoyable   watch .
253224316	2171	4.5	only   just   watched   this   film   and   thought   it   was   very   good .    definitely   got   the   brotherly    ['] love [']    thing   right !
253224316	3385	2.0	went   to   see   this   at   cinema   and   found   it   a   little   creepy ,    but   then   i   lost   interest   about   half   way   through !    film ['] s   not   bad ,    just   not   one   i   enjoyed   particularly !
253224316	9702	4.5	this   is   good ,    and   the   songs   in   it   make   it   even   better !  !

253224316	7032	3.0	this   was   the   least   funny   austin   powers   movie !
253224316	7989	4.5	a   good   soppy   cartoon !  !    i   always   felt   i   could   connect   with   the   beast .  .  .  .          lol
253224316	14312	4.0	i   remember   loving   this   as   a   child .    the   effects   are   pretty   good ,    and   it   has   dinosaurs   in !  !
253224316	2430	4.5	i   like   the   alien   films .    do   have   a   thing   for   space / alien   concepts   though !
253224316	17703	0.5	this   was   a   terrible   adaption   of   a   great   comic !    found   it   really   boring   and   don ['] t   think   i   even   made   it   to   the   end !
253224316	15163	2.5	not   bad .    i   enjoyed   this   film .    but   i   don ['] t   think   i   would    ['] choose [']    to   watch   it   again   if   something   else   was   on   offer !
253224316	2152	4.0	this   film   has   some   really   funny   moments   and   enjoyable   throughout !
253224316	2153	2.0	not   really   my   sort   of   film ,    and   once   is   enough   i   think !
253224316	4306	4.5	i   loved   this   film ,    even   though   someone   ruined   the   ending   for   me !    some   brilliant   jumpy   moments ,    with   a   great   twist !
116666855	1102	3.5	quite   a   good   film .    the   acting   was   great .
116666855	3524	3.5	incredibly   overated ,    don ['] t   see   what   is   so   special   about   this   film .    if   someone   knows   please   tell   me .    maybe   i   just   don ['] t   understand   it   or   need   to   watch   it   a   second   time .
116666855	3287	4.0	an   action   packed   film   with   a   new   female   terminator .    although   not   directed   by   james   cameron   of   the   earlier   terminator   films ,    this   is   still   an   exciting   and   explosive   action   filled   film .
116666855	14590	4.0	i   think   this   film   just   about   beats   die   hard   2 .    bruce   willis   and   samuel   l   jackson   are   good   together .    jeremy   irons   was   a   fairly   good   bad   guy .    however   the   first   die   hard   is   still   the   best   in   my   opinion .
116666855	17339	4.0	the   classic   film   by   stanley   kubrick ,    which   really   gets   across   the   madness   of   war ,    but   more   specifically   the   indoctrination   of   soldiers   into   killing   machines   and   the   emotional   effects   it   has   on   them .    well   known   for   r .    lee   emery ['] s   famous   and   brilliant   performance   as   the   drill   instructor .    the   first   part   follows   the   new   marine   recruits   being   trained ,    while   the   second   half   of   the   film   follows   them   in   vietnam .    the   film   also   had   a   really   good   soundtrack   which   i   thought   worked   really   well .    overall   a   good   film ,    worth   watching .
116666855	5496	5.0	will   smith   is   really   good   in   this   film   and   the   part   where   the   robots   attack   his   car   is   pretty   impressive .
116666855	12870	5.0	everyone   should   see   this   film .    spielberg ['] s   best   film   ever .    the   entire   cast   is   brilliant ,    with   excellent   performances .
116666855	8809	2.0	this   star   trek   film   has   some   great   action   scenes   as   well   as   a   great   opening   sequence .    however   there   are   many   plot   holes   in   this   film   which   ultimatley   let   it   down .    although   i   could   go   into   great   detail   about   these   plot   holes   i   won ['] t   bother   as   those   who   are   fans   of   star   trek   the   next   generation   won ['] t   need   them   spelling   out   for   them .    however   it   was   sad   that   this   was   the   last   film ,    with   the   next   generation   cast .    it   didn ['] t   seem   a   very   fitting   end   to   their   adventures   and   being   a   big   fan   and   having   watched   the   television   series   since   i   was   younger   i   was   very   disappointed .    the   director   stuart   baird   should   take   the   blame   for   the   poorness   of   this   film .    he   had   never   even   watched   an   episode   of   star   trek   and   later   claimed   it   was    " silly "    yet   somehow   he   was   still   chosen   to   direct   the   film .    a   much   better   choice   would   have   been   jonathan   frakes   who   had   proven   himself   with   the   direction   of   star   trek :    first   contact   and   star   trek :    insurrection .    the   film   is   virtually   a   rip   off   of   superior   star   trek   films ,    the   wrath   of   khan   and   the   undiscovered   country .    there   were   also   some   important   deleted   scenes   which   were   not   included   which   could   have   helped   improve   the   film   and   wrap   up   the   stories   of   certain   characters   and   make   it   seem   like   it   really   was   tng ['] s   final   outing .    these   included   such   things   as   the   character   of   doctor   crusher   leaving   the   enterprise   to   take   command   of   starfleet   medical .    sadly   however   many   of   these   scenes   were   ommited   from   the   film .    instead   we   are   left   with   a   film   which   has   a   rather   bizzare   plot ,    which   really   doesn ['] t   make   much   sense   and   which   throws   away   many   of   the   established   plots   and   trademarks   built   up   during   tng ['] s   television   series .       there   are   a   couple   of   scenes   in   the   film   which   are   still   enjoyable   such   as   the      action   sequences   and   great   special   effects   if   you   like   the   star   trek   films   then   its   worth   seeing   at   least   once .    however   as   the   last   film   with   the   next   generation ,    it   is   a   big   let   down   and   i   am   not   surprised   that   many   of   the   cast   such   as   patrick   stewart ,    levar   burton   and   marina   sirtis   have   criticised   this   film .
116666855	13610	5.0	i   think   this   is   probably   the   best   spider - man   film   and   is   one   of   the   best   marvel   films   next   to   x - men .
116666855	7397	5.0	robin   williams   is   a   total   legend   in   this   film .    pure   comedy !    i   can   always   watch   this   film   again   and   again   and   i   never   get   tired   of   it .    a   very   funny   film   which   is   a   must   see !
116666855	2186	3.5	a   good   action   film .    with   some   funny   parts   as   well .    will   smith   and   martin   lawrance   were   very   good .
116666855	10027	4.0	although   i   am   not   really   a   fan   of   the   original   star   trek   films ,    i   have   to   admit   this   is   pretty   good .    i   give   it   four   stars   for   the   great   plot   as   well   as   the   acting   by   ricardo   montalban .    also   has   a   good   score   by   james   horner .
116666855	7664	5.0	great   inspiring   film .       probably   ridley   scott ['] s   best   film .    a   great   story ,    told   well   which   can   be   watched   again   and   again .    russell   crowe ['] s   acting   is   excellent   along   with   the   rest   of   the   cast .    i   particulalry   liked   oliver   reed ,    who   sadly   died   during   the   making   of   the   film .    its   a   shame   this   film   didn ['] t   win   best   score .    i   think   the   music   is   fantastic   and   possibly   hans   zimmer ['] s   best .
116666855	11398	4.0	really   funny   film ,    with   a   bunch   of   crazy ,    wacky   people   on   a   plane !  !  !    there   is   no   other   way   to   describe   it !
116666855	2992	3.0	a   rather   cheesy   action   film .    its   really   nothing   special .    there   are   far   better   action   movies   out   there .    look   out   for   arnold   schwarzenegger   in   a   cameo   role .
116666855	2452	5.0	this   is   a   brilliant   film .    the   first   part   of   the   epic   film   trilogy   excellently   directed   by   peter   jackson .    it   was   vey   ambitious   and   daunting   to   adapt   a   book   such   as   the   lord   of   the   rings   to   the   big   screen .    but   the   result   is   amazing .    i   think   every   actor   fits   their   role   perfectly   and   is   just   as   i   imagined   them   in   the   book .    ian   mckellen ['] s   gandalf   is   spot   on   while   christopher   lee ['] s   saruman   is   better   than   i   could   have   hoped   for .    the   film   boasts   some   impressive   special   effects   thanks   to   peter   jacksons   effects   company   weta   digital   which   shows   its   skill ,    one   notable   example   being   the   mines   of   moria .    the   music   is   also   superb   and   matches   well   with   the   film .    the   cinematography   is   also   great   and   i   think   is   even   more   so   in   the   two   towers   and   the   return   of   the   king .    the   choice   of   new   zealand   for   filming   couldn ['] t   have   been   better   and   the   incredible   landscapes   are   put   to   good   use   to   really   bring   the   world   of   middle   earth   alive .          although   some   things   have   been   slightly   changed   in   the   film   from   the   book ,    that   is   only   to   be   expected   and   i   don ['] t   think   it   impacts   on   the   overall   quality   of   the   film .    i   have   heard   some   people   complain   about   the   length   of   the   films   but   to   me   that   doesn ['] t   matter ,    because   the   film   is   so   engrossing   and   it   just   sucks   you   right   in .    overall   an   incredible   film   well   worth   watching   along   with   its   two   impressive   sequels .
116666855	7057	5.0	even   better   than   the   first ,    especially   the   battle   at   helm ['] s   deep ,    which   i   consider   to   be   the   best   battle   scene   in   any   film .
116666855	1406	4.5	hook   is   a   good   film   although   had   a   bit   more   of   a   hollywood   style ,    but   is   still   great .
116666855	4043	4.0	i   really   like   this   film   and   think   its   probably   m .    night   shyamalan ['] s   best   film .    i   became   dissapointed   with   this   director   after   i   watched   the   village ,    but   i   still   think   this   film   is   great .    i   like   ufos   and   aliens   and   stuff   so   it   kind   of   appeals   to   me .    however   you   don ['] t   have   to   be   into   that   stuff   to   watch   this   film .    mel   gibson   is   great   in   it .    the   part   at   the   brazillian   boys   birthday   party   sh *  * s   me   up   big   time   lol !
116666855	4109	4.0	this   is   a   some   what   strange   movie ,    but      i   quite   liked   it   and   i   think   i ['] ll   like   it   even   more   when   i   watch   it   again .    christian   bale   gives   a   great   performance .    worth   watching .
116666855	14545	5.0	this   film   is   good   for   only   one   reason .    keira   knightley ['] s   in   it .    no   seriously   this   is   a   good   film .    i   had   to   watch   it   again   to   fully   like   it   but   now   i   think   its   great .    i   really   like   hans   zimmer ['] s   musical   score   in   this   film   as   well .    overall   regardless   of   whether   or   not   this   has   any   historical   basis ,    it   is   still   a   fun   film   to   watch   and   i   really   like   it .
116666855	1625	4.5	possibly   one   of   the   greatest   film   sequels   of   all   time ,    alongside   the   likes   of   terminator   2    ( also   a   james   cameron   film )  ,    and   the   empire   strikes   back .    the   effects   are   great   even   today ,    specifically   the   aliens ,    who   look   disgusting   and   creepy .    more   action   than   the   first   alien   film ,    this   still   builds   up   suspense   well   and   has   a   fantastic   ending .    the   score   to   the   film   is   also   very   good   and   well   recognised ,    as   part   of   it   has   often   been   used   in   trailers .    james   horner   did   a   good   job   especially   as   he   basically   composed   the   score   overnight .    by   most   accounts   james   cameron   is   a   difficult   director   to   work   with   and   is   something   of   a   perfectionist .    he   knows   what   he   wants   and   he   usually   gets   it   and   produces   outstanding   films .
116666855	9757	3.0	i   loved   this   film .
116666855	1865	4.5	really   enjoyed   this   film .    wonderfully   eccentric   and   strange ,    yet   captivating   and   emotive .    the   cast   were   excellent .    kudos   to   carrey   and   winslet   whose   acting   was   brilliant .    good   acting   also   from   the   rest   of   the   cast .    the   dialogue   in   the   film   was   great   and   seemed   so   natural .    could   be   a   bit   confusing   the   first   time   you   watch   it ,    but   its   still   really   good .
116666855	299	0.5	i   hate   renee   zellweger ,    she   gets   on   my   nerves .    bridget   jones ['] s   diary   is   just   so   pathetic   and   cliched .
116666855	11710	4.5	this   is   a   good   film   with   action   and   humour .       will   smith   and   tommy   lee   jones   are   great   together .
116666855	15078	4.0	" jumanji !  "    one   cool   film .    totally   better   than   that   zathura   crap !    a   fun   and   enjoyable   film   with   a   very   interesting   storyline .
116666855	8553	1.0	do   not   make   you   eyes   burn   by   watching   this   disgraceful   excuse   for   a   film .    i   suppose   the   reason   i   don ['] t   like   it   is   because   when   i   see   it   now   it   seems   very   cheesy   and   i   tend   to   forget   that   i   watched   it   when   i   was   younger .
116666855	1307	3.5	an   okay   film .  .  . nothing   special   really .
116666855	6398	5.0	this   film   is   great   and   really   makes   me   laugh
116666855	11182	4.0	an   excellent   film ,    very   accurate   historically ,    well   acted   and   great   action   sequences .
116666855	13417	0.5	this   was   total   crap
116666855	8079	3.5	didn ['] t   think   it   was   that   amazing .    but   i   liked   tom   cruise ['] s   performance .
116666855	3466	0.5	this   film   is   pathetic   all   copies   should   be   destroyed .    i   think   this   film   is   ludicrous .
116666855	78	3.0	i   watched   this   all   the   time   when   i   was   younger !    it   seems   stupid   now   and   funny   when   i   think   about   the   film .
116666855	16604	4.0	a   good   film ,    with   great   performances ,    however   i   feel   its   a   tiny   bit   overated .    i ['] ll   probably   have   to   watch   it   again   to   fully   appreciate   it .
116666855	2523	5.0	this   film   is   still   cool .
116666855	16605	4.0	good   film ,    had   a   nice   soundtrack .    although   they   are   two   different   films ,    i   prefer   dances   with   wolves .    this   was   still   good   though .
116666855	13673	5.0	the   first   and   the   best   computer   animated   film .    the   animation   is   flawless ,    the   storyline   is   original   and   funny ,    the   voice   actors   are   perfect .    pure   genius .    this   film   never   gets   old .
116666855	14780	0.5	this   is   total   crap   and   very   weird
116666855	5408	4.0	okay   i   don ['] t   like   the   original   star   trek   and   have   never   actually   watched   one   of   the   original   star   trek   films   all   the   way   through .    however   i   watched   this   and   i   have   to   say   that   it   was   pretty   good .    it   had   a   very   interesting   plot ,    good   acting ,    and   decent   special   effects .    it   was   overall   a   fun   and   enjoyable   film   to   watch   and   if   you   were   to   watch   any   of   the   star   trek   films ,    especially   if   your   not   a   star   trek   fan      i   would   recommend   this   or   the   excellent   star   trek   first   contact .
116666855	14149	4.0	this   film   is   incredibly   relevent   to   today ['] s   britain .    especailly   in   regards   to   telecommunications   monitoring .    it   was   a   good   thriller .    quite   good   acting .    overall   this   was   an   enjoyable   film .    not   the   greatest   i ['] ve   seen   but   still   very   good   and   interesting .
116666855	4216	3.0	a   rather   poor   sequel   to   be   honest .    shouldn ['] t   really   have   been   made .
116666855	6365	5.0	this   is   a   good   film   really .    the   action   scenes   are   good   and   it   does   have   a   good   cast   and   a   very   good   story .    ridley   scott   is   a   great   director .    the   film   was   much   better   the   second   time   round .
116666855	2776	3.5	personally   i   didn ['] t   enjoy   this   film .    samuel   l .    jackson ['] s   performance   was   quite   good ,    but   i   found   the   film   overall   to   be   rather   dull .
116666855	2782	3.5	good   directing   and   wonderful   landscapes   as   well   as   very   good   battle   scenes .    however   its   inaccurate ,    biased   and   highly   exaggerated ,    to   depict   the   english   as   barbarians .    much   the   same   as   what   mel   gibson   did   in   the   patriot .    i   think   mel   gibson   must   have   something   against   the   english .    this   film   would   have   been   so   good   if   wasn ['] t   for   the   inaccuracies   and   sheer   hollywood   depiction   of   it   all .    about   the   only   accurate   thing   about   it   is   that   there   was   a   scottish   man   called   william   wallace .    probably   one   of   my   favourite   fantasy   films .
116666855	3730	4.0	cate   blanchett   gives   a   powerful   and   extraordinary   performance   as   the   virgin   queen ,    taking   us   through   the   trails   of   her   early   reign .    wonderful   costumes ,    along   with   some   great   camerawork ,    particularly   the   opening   scene .    the   acting   from   the   rest   of   the   cast   is   also   really   good .    sadly   cate   blanchett   lost   out   on   an   oscar   for   this   role ,    which   is   a   shame   as   she   certainly   deserved   one .
116666855	2783	3.5	used   to   watch   this   when   i   was   younger .       one   of   the   witches   flew   out   on   a   hoover   instead   of   a   broom   lol .  .  .  .  . god   am   sad .
116666855	13651	3.0	this   film   had   some   exciting   parts ,    i ['] ll   admit   it ,    but   the   rest   wasn ['] t   spectacular .    add   in   some   overly   dramatic   music   some   cheesy   lines   and   american   patriotic   drivel   about   the   commander   in   chief   and   how    " they   can ['] t   do   that   to   america "    etc   etc ,    and   you ['] ve   got   a   recipe   for   overall ,    a   very   mediocre   film   at   best .

116666855	13402	4.0	a   fun   film ,    i ['] d   sort   of   like   to   read   the   book   now .    the   acting   was   good   throughout .    i   especially   liked   richard   harris   as   he   taught   dantes   and   acted   as   his   wise   mentor .    i   thought   quite   a   few   times   throughout   the   film   that   james   caviezel   had   the   look   of   christian   bale   about   him .    talking   of   looks   luis   guzman   who   played   dantes [']    loyal   friend   looked   very   odd ,    the   hair   cut   he   had   just   looked   really   silly   and   just   didn ['] t   suit   him .    i   liked   the   fight   scene   at   the   end   although   i   thought   it   could   have   been   slightly   longer ,    but   they   kept   it   fairly   short   and   too   the   point   and   didn ['] t   go   over   the   top   with   it   which   was   good .    the   story   could   have   had   more   added   in   i   thought .    although   i   haven ['] t   read   the   boko   so   i   can ['] t   compare .    overall   it   was   pretty   good .    it   wasn ['] t   spectacular   by   any   means ,       but   it   is   certainly   worth   a   watch .
116666855	16879	4.0	i   actually   thought   this   was   a   decent   film .    well   directed   and   the   effects   were   cool .
116666855	16377	4.5	this   was   a   great   film .    not   really   a   fan   of   tom   hanks   but   i   really   liked   him   in   this   film .    its   really   good   and   has   some   brilliant   performances   with   a   very   interesting   plot .
116666855	1073	3.5	a   pretty   good   film ,    similar   to   remember   the   titans .    samuel   l   jackson   does   some   very   good   acting .
116666855	10053	5.0	just   fun   to   watch .  .  . and   sing   along   with .  .  . joke
116666855	12317	4.0	a   good   action   movie   and   with   a      great   cast   sean   connery ,    nicolas   cage ,    this   is   a   movie   which   has   to   be   seen .    good   all   round   entertainment ,    although   it   has   a   couple   of   cheesy   scenes .    the   marines   dialogue   in   the   film   pretty   much   consisted   of   yes   sir ,    no   sir ,    three   bags   full   sir   and   after   a   bit   it   became   slightly   annoying .
116666855	4266	4.0	a   powerful   and   intense   film .    incredible   performance   by   james   caviezel .    there   is   no   doubting   that   this   is   a   really   well   made   film ,    possibly   mel   gibson ['] s   best .    i   felt   the   violence   was   realistic   and   not   just   violence   for   the   sake   of   violence .
116666855	6099	3.5	i   thought   this   was   a   very   strange   film   and   didn ['] t   fully   understand   it .    but   it   had   some   great   parts ,    especially   the   helicopter   attack   on   the   village   whilst   playing   wagner !    the   cast   was   great   as   well   and   there   are   some   memorable   lines .    if   you   like   war   films   this   is   a   film   to   see .

116666855	14928	4.0	a   pretty   good   film .    robin   williams   is   as   always   great   and   its   always   good   to   see   him   in   non - comedic   roles .    the   film   is   quite   inspiring   and   a   little   sad   at   the   same   time .

116666855	13955	4.0	this   film   is   in   no   way   perfect ,    but   i   still   liked   it   enough   to   give   it   4   stars .    i   like   adrien   brody   and   keira   knightley   although   they   didn ['] t   seem   to   have   much   chemistry   on   screen   together .    the   story   is   interesting   if   a   little   bizzare   and   hard   to   follow   at   times .    there   are   a   few   unanswered   questions   but   it   kind   of   leaves   the   film   open   to   interpretation .    still   there   are   some   good   parts   and   overall   its   not   a   bad   film .
116666855	6196	5.0	fantastic   film   from   james   cameron .    its   a   total   classic   and   schwarzenegger ['] s   iconic   role .    there   isn ['] t   much   else   to   say   about   this   film ,    except   it   is   pure   quality .
116666855	16387	4.5	this   was   a   direct   to   video   film   but   i   think   is   just   as   good   as   the   first   aladdin   film .
116666855	11283	5.0	i   only   saw   this   film   fairly   recently ,    after   most   people   had   already   seen   it .    i   was   surprised   at   how   good   it   was   and   how   much   i   enjoyed   it .    i   enjoyed   tom   hanks [']    performance   and   i   am   not   usually   a   massive   fan   of   tom   hanks ,    but   i   am   beginning   to   like   him   as   an   actor   more   and   more .    the   story   flows   perfectly   and   is   edited   perfectly   along   with   the   music .    a   wonderful   film .    the   director   robert   zemeckis   has   also   become   one   of   my   favourites .
116666855	16668	4.0	a   few   good   performances .  .  .  .  .
116666855	9628	5.0	this   film   is   great .    the   only   think   that   i   don ['] t   like   that   much   are   the   ewoks .    other   than   that   i   think   this   film   is   great   and   rounds   the   saga   off   well .    classic .
116666855	406	3.5	a   good   thriller .    bruce   willis   is   great .
116666855	673	4.5	a   bizzare   yet   highly   entertaining   film .    edward   norton   and   brad   pitt   were   great .    this   is   a   film   you   definitely   have   to   watch   twice .
116666855	10168	1.5	its   a   shame .    i   think   this   film   could   have   had   the   potential   to   be   something   big .    instead   it   turns   out   to   be   a   ridiculous ,    farcical   film   with   unbelieveable   characters   and   plot .    if   you   want   to   see   an   alan   moore   graphic   novel   adaptation   film   i   suggest   you   see   v   for   vendetta   which   is   one   hell   of   a   good   watch .
116666855	12092	0.5	what   the   hell   was   i   thinking   when   i   went   to   see   this   at   the   cinema   for   my   birthday .    someone   should   have   slapped   me .    this   film   basically   turns   into   the   most   silly   and   stupid   film   i   have   ever   seen .    it   makes   me   cringe   if   ever   i   see   any   of   it .    george   clooney   has   even   said   if   anyone   tells   him   they   paid   money   to   go   and   see   it   and   they   didn ['] t   like   it ,    then   he ['] ll   refund   them   the   cost   himself .
116666855	14210	4.0	this   was   the   first   japanese   animation   film   i ['] d   ever   seen ,    although   i ['] d   seen   a   bit   of   spirited   away .    this   film   was   very   good   and   very   well   made ,    with   the   animation   being   excellent .    a   very   sad   film .
116666855	11812	5.0	one   of   the   best   films   i   have   ever   seen .    a   true   story   and   great   acting .    i   didn ['] t   think   this   was   my   kind   of   film ,    primarilly   for   its   focus   on   boxing .    but   in   a   way   thats   just   one   part   of   the   story .    its   just   a   great   film .  .  .
116666855	13255	5.0	this   is   an   excellent   film .    with   an   overall   theme   of   racism   it   is   a   powerful   and   emotional   film .    has   a   great   cast   and   made   me   think   a   lot   about   myself   and   the   people   around   me .
116666855	6400	4.0	good   film ,    with   good   performances   all   round .    another   good   spielberg   film .
116666855	5054	3.5	this   is   more   of   an   intelligent   action / thriller   without   any   major   shoot   outs .    i   have   to   admit   about   an   hour   into   the   film   and   didn ['] t   really   have   any   idea   what   was   going   on .    however   the   film   keeps   your   attention   and   the   scene   in   cia   headquaters   has   now   become   a   classic .    i   prerfer   mission   impossible   3   personally ,    but   this   is   still   fairly   good .    just   avoid   mission   impossible   2 .
116666855	3195	4.0	a   good   war   film   portraying   american   troops   landing   on   omaha   beach   on   d - day   during   world   war   ii .    although   an   epic   and   moving   film ,    i   think   their   is   far   too   much   focus   upon   the   americans   and   gives   no   acknowledgement   to   the   british   or   other   nationalities   which   took   part   in   d - day .    i   am   tempted   to   say   its   a   load   of   patriotic   american   drivel ,    but   i   won ['] t   go   that   far .
116666855	9381	5.0	incredibly   moving   film .    outstanding   performances   throughout   with   great   cinematography .    i   was   really   surprised   to   learn   that   john   hurt   did   not   win   an   oscar   for   his   performance .    this   film   is   brilliantly   made   and   emotionally   touching .
116666855	15205	3.5	an   alright   film ,    with   cool   effects ,    didn ['] t   realise   a   film   about   the   weather   could   be   so   exciting .
116666855	14671	5.0	this   film   is   superb ,    although   its   in   german .    but   it   makes   it   more   realistic   and   you   get   used   to   subtitles .                bruno   ganz   is   fantastic   as   adolf   hitler   and   the   guy   who   plays   goebbels   is   such   a   look   alike   for   the   real   guy   that   its   scary .
116666855	14670	4.0	this   is   the   second   best   batman   film   next   to   batman   begins .    jack   nicholson   is   brilliant   as   the   joker .
116666855	3425	4.0	hmmm   not   entirely   sure   what   to   make   of   this   film .    it   had   great   acting   and   directing   and   had   some   real   good   scenes .
116666855	12034	4.0	a   classic   film .    jack   nicholson   is   superb   in   this   film ,    in   one   of   his   most   memorable   and   iconic   roles .    the   film   i   thought   was   not   really   scary      but   creepy .       however   the   only   negative   point   i   have   is   that   shelley   duvall   was   crap   in   this   film .    she   spent   half   the   film   looking   gormless   and   stupid   and   she   didn ['] t   really   seem   to   fit   in   correctly .    if   you   like   the   film ,    read   the   book   because   its   just   as   good .  .  .  . but   somehow   i   doubt   many   of   you   will   do   that .

116666855	9886	5.0	although   it   does   seem   a   bit   more   geared   towards   children   in   parts ,    it   does   have   its   good   points ,    especially   the   lightsaber   fight .
116666855	5582	5.0	probably   the   best   star   wars   film .    the   luke   vs   vader   fight   is   very   good .    plus   the   ending   is   just   legendary .
116666855	7511	4.0	a   good   action   movie ,    with   a   good   performance   from   wesley   snipes .    blade   is   one   cool   character ,    good   fight   scenes ,    but   the   film   got   a   little   crazy   towards   the   end .
116666855	3925	4.5	a   very   good   sequel   with   a   great   opening   sequence .       the   special   effects   are   again   fantastic ,    with   the   freeway   scene   being   an   example .
116666855	6736	2.0	not   as   good   as   i   thought   it   would   be .    it   just   wasn ['] t   that   funny .

116666855	6037	4.0	very   good ,    although   i   think   a   little   overated .    a   man   is   pulled   from   the   sea   with   two   bullet   holes   in   his   back   with   no   memory   of   who   he   is   or   where   he   came   from .    however   he   is   skilled   in   hand   to   hand   combat   and   the   use   of   weapons ,    while   a   saftey   deposit   box   in   a   bank   in   switzerland   reveals   several   passports ,    a   large   amount   of   cash   and   a   gun .    very   soon   however ,    he   finds   himself   being   pursued   by   u . s   government   agents   who   wish   to   kill   him .    this   is   a   very   good   action   thriller   with   realistic   action   and   car   chases .    matt   damon ['] s   acting   is   pretty   good   and   the   direction   is   solid   also .    i   don ['] t   think   this   film   deserved   a   sequel ,    let   alone   two .
116666855	2372	4.0	a   pretty   pointless   sequel .    the   storyline   was   almost   the   same   as   the   first   film ,    with   a   slight   variation .    basically   running   around   different   cities ,    wondering   who   he   is ,    not   being   able   to   remember   things .    mysterious   cia   operatives   and   assassins   and   car   chases .    brian   cox   was   particularly   good .    apart   from   that   the   bourne   identity   is   still   the   best .
116666855	15105	3.0	omg   he   got   killed   by   wasps !  !  !  !
116666855	12732	3.5	this   was   a   pretty   good   film ,    viggo   mortensen   is   really   good .    it ['] s   a   good   story   and   also   has   good   action   in   it   as   well .

116666855	3638	4.0	director   michael   bay   is   the   master   of   car   chases   and   pulls   off   a   spectacular   one   in   this   film .    it   was   probably   one   of   the   best   chase   scenes   i   have   seen   in   a   film .    although   the   chase   scene   in   the   island   was   also   very   good .    will   smith   and   martin   lawrance   work   well   together ,    the   action   is   true   to   michael   bay   films ,    with   huge   explosions ,    exciting   car   chases   and   hectic   gun   battles .    this   film   is   pretty   much   a   ridiculous   no   brainer   action   movie ,    but   for   what   it   is   its   quite   good .    although   personally   i   prefer   the   first   bad   boys   film .
116666855	468	3.5	i   had   read   reviews   saying   this   wasn ['] t   as   good   as   the   two   previous   matrix   films .    i   was   hoping   they   were   wrong ,    but   sadly   its   true .    i   think   one   of   the   reasons   may   be   that   this   film   is   a   direct   continuation   from   the   end   of   the   matrix   reloaded .    there   isn ['] t   really   any   spectacular   opening   scene .  .  .  . just   talking .    i   don ['] t   know   whether   they   filmed   both   the   matrix   reloaded   and   revolutions   back   to   back ,    but   that   might   explain   it .    either   way   it   still   has   great   special   effects ,    but   as   an   end   to   the   trilogy   it   could   have   been   better .
116666855	3333	0.5	this   film   stinks !    not   one   of   m   night   shyamalan ['] s   best   films .    i   thought   the   plot   was   strange   and   the   ending   was   even   stranger .    it   was   a   major   dissapointment .
116666855	6720	4.0	i ['] d   wanted   to   see   this   ridley   scott   film   for   a   while   and   it   was   better   than   i   expected .    very   good ,    i ['] ll   definitely   watch   it   again .
116666855	15945	5.0	space   jam   rocks !
116666855	16469	1.0	i   thought   this   was   a   really   poor   film .    it   had   the   chance   to   be   great .    combining   the   two   movie   icons   of   alien   and   predator .    instead   we   get   a   poorly   acted   and   scripted   film ,    which   at   times   borders   on   the   ridiculous .    give   this   film   a   miss   and   instead   just   watch   the   alien   and   predator   films ,    rather   than   this   horrible   film ,    which   does   an   injustice   to   the   franchises   it   tries   to   bring   together .
116666855	3626	5.0	edward   norton   gives   yet   another   great   performance !
116666855	3624	5.0	a   great   film .    ignore   any   historical   inaccuracies   and   just   enjoy   the   film .    good   acting ,    great   fight   scenes   and   also   some   very   good   music .
116666855	13567	4.0	a   crazy   but   great   film .    i ['] ve   never   really   seen   a   film   like   it .
116666855	6029	4.5	a   great   film .    everyone   should   watch   this .
116666855	753	5.0	total   classic ,    especially   where   they   go   round   to   that   guys   house   and   have   a   tea   party   on   the   ceiling .    what   the   hell   was   all   that   about ?    its   like   they   were   stoned   or   something   lol .
116666855	14047	4.5	possibly   the   best   bruce   willis   film   i ['] ve   seen   since   his   die   hard   days , along   with   the   sixth   sense .    great   film ,    good   acting ,    good   script .    no   gung - ho   american   nonesense   as   i   expected   it   would   be .    another   good   film    ( along   with   blood   diamond ,    hotel   rwanda   and   lord   of   war ) highlighting   the   plight   of   africa
116666855	8881	3.5	a   dark   and   in   places   violent   sci - fi   movie .    i   think   this   film   is   quite   underated .    its   quite   good ,    although   the   beginning   was   too   quick   and   you   never   get   to   see   murphy   as   the   real   person   he   was   and   what   sort   of   cop   he   was .    apart   from   that   this   is   a   fairly   good   film ,    with   some   memorable   lines .
116666855	3079	5.0	in   my   opinion ,    one   of   the   best   disney   films   ever   made .    not   necessarily   for   children ,    its   a   nice   film .
116666855	14050	3.0	i   loved   this   film   when   i   was   younger   and   i   reckon   its      a   lot   better   than   the   new   one   they   brought   out .
116666855	5793	3.5	a   rather   dull   film ,    wasn ['] t   as   good   as   i   expected   it   to   be .    i   kind   of   felt   like   i   was   missing   part   of   the   backstory   as   to   the   war   between   the   vampires   and   lycans .    it   didn ['] t   make   too   much   sense   to   be   honest .    i   didn ['] t   think   the   acting   was   of   an   outstanding   quality   either .
116666855	15151	3.5	this   was   a   fairly   good   film .    however   it   wasn ['] t   very   inspiring   and   the   characters   could   have   been   explored   a   bit   more   as   they   seemed   a   little   undeveloped .    however   some   good   action   and   a   film   you   should   see   if   you   like   the   rock .    its   a   good   film   to   watch ,    just   to   see   the   rock   kick   the   crap   out   of   everyone .  .  .  . like   most   of   his   films .  .  .
116666855	11022	4.0	a   fascinating   film !    you   either   love   it   or   hate   it .
116666855	5814	5.0	a   fantastic   performance   from   robin   williams   and   not   what   you   usually   expect   from   him ,    but   this   really   shows   how   great   and   versatile   an   actor   he   really   is .    although   the   character   he   plays   is   creepy   and   at   times   disturbing ,    i   did   feel   some   sympathy   for   him .    overall   a   great   film ,    well   worth   watching !
116666855	8379	3.0	this   film   was   fairly   weak   in   the   first   half   i   thought ,    but   in   the   second   half   the   drama   and   tension   really   starts   to   pick   up .    rachel   weiz   was   great ,    however   i   didn ['] t   like   jude   law   at   all ,    i   thought   he   was   a   pretty   bad   choice   for   the   role   and   his   acting   wasn ['] t   that   good ,    not   to   mention   his   accent .    the   accents   of   the   characters   was   a   major   let   down   for   this   film ,    i   think   they   could   have   at   least   attempted   to   put   on   a   russian   accent   like   bob   hoskins   did   in   the   film .    ed   harris   was   great   and   i   thought   he   was   the   perfect   choice   to   play   the   german   sniper .    overall   once   you ['] ve   got   used   to   the   actors   not   using   a   russian   accent ,    this   is   a   fairly   good   film ,    if   you   ignore   some   bad   points   and   some   of   the   historical   inaccuracies .
116666855	10275	4.0	a   lot   better   than   i   expected .    not   your   typical   american   teen   comedy ,    of   which   i   usually   hate .    although   to   be   honest   the   story   is   highly   implausible ,    it   has   a   heart   to   the   story   and   a   charm   which   i   just   couldn ['] t   help   but   like .    it   was   also   quite   funny   in   parts .    i   feel   that   this   film   is   quite   underated   as   people   asume   it   to   be   something   that   it   its   not ,    especially   considering   the   storyline .
116666855	7032	3.5	funny   film ,    it ['] s   good .
116666855	7989	4.0	yeah   i   liked   this   film .    although   i   can ['] t   remember   the   names   of   the   candle   and   the   clock .
116666855	14618	4.5	& quot ; we   accept   the   reality   of   the   world   with   which   we   are   presented .  & quot ;       jim   carrey   is   brilliant   as   truman   burbank ,    the   man   who   has   no   idea   that   his   entire   life   has   been   filmed   as   a   tv   show   since   his   birth   and   his   home   town   is   a   gigantic   set .    its   great   to   see   carrey   in   a   dramatic   role   and   he   plays   it   wonderfully .    the   film   is   an   intelligent   look   at   today ['] s   media   and   television   as   well   as   the   idea   of   reality   and   it   is   well   directed   by   peter   weir .    i   think   this   film   deserved   an   oscar ,    but   no   such   luck   sadly .    this   is   definitely   one   to   watch ,    even   if   you   don ['] t   like   jim   carrey .    it   might   just   change   your   mind .
116666855	14312	5.0	one   of   spielberg ['] s   best .    the   dinosaurs   are   great ,    even   today .    i   like   all   the   actors   in   in   it :    sam   neil ,    jeff   goldblum ,    richard   attenborough   etc .    a   total   classic !
116666855	14313	3.5	i   was   going   to   give   this   4   stars   but   changed   my   mind .    this   film   could   very   well   have   been   brilliant ,    but   it   is   let   down   by   the   historial   inaccuray   and   the   portrayal   of   the   british .    the   british   are   shown   to   be   vicious ,    uncaring   and   nazi   like .    there   are   many   times   in   the   film   where   you   could   exchange   a   redcoat   for   an   ss   uniform   and   you   wouldn ['] t   notice   the   difference   between   the   two .    the   worst   scene   in   the   film   was   the    * spoilers *    burning   of   the   villagers   in   the   church ,    which   was   an   almost   exact   copy   of   a   real   life   attorcity   carried   out   by   the   nazis   in   oradour   in   france   in   the   second   world   war .    it   seems   that   roland   emmerich   who   is   german ,    somehow   wanted   to   associate   such   crimes   with   the   british   for   some   reason .    it      was   bad   enough   mel   gibson   doing   braveheart   without   starring   in   this   film   as   well .       the   good   points   of   the   film   were   the   acting   by   gibson   and   the   rest   of   the   cast ,    which   was   really   good ,    the   wonderful   battle   scenes   and   the   rousing   score   by   john   williams .    this   film   is   in   no   way   accurate   and   is   if   we ['] re   honest   pure   hollywood   propaganda   crap .    i   could   almost   have   imagined   this   film   being   released   after   the   events   of   9 / 11   just   like   pearl   harbour   was .    the   sad   thing   is   some   people   will   watch   this   film   and   accept   it   as   historical   fact ,    which   it   is   the   furthest   from .
116666855	2430	4.5	one   of   the   greatest   sci - fi   films   ever   made .    a   combination   of   sci - fi   horror   this   film   is   excellent .    brilliantly   directed   by   ridley   scott   with   excellent   special   effects   and   make   up   even   for   today .    has   one   of   the   most   famous   scenes   in   cinema   history   and   the   film   works   so   well   on   a   scary   level   by   never   actualy   shoing   the   audience   a   clear   full   shot   of   the   alien .    great   stuff ,    along   with   its   just   as   good   sequel .
116666855	3860	3.5	i   do   prefer   jim   carrey   in   dramatic   roles ,    but   this   was   ok .    morgan   freeman   was   pretty   amusing   as   god .    however   a   lot   of   the   humour   and   jokes   in   the   film   were   cheesy   and   wern ['] t   that   funny .

324848473	14691	5.0	a   fantastic   and   groundbreaking   film .    i   wish   the   sequals   had   be   more   so .
324848473	2985	2.5	a   great   comedy   bordering   on   the   obscene .    somehow   they   balanced   it   and   started   a   trend .
324848473	11077	2.0	funny ,    but   still   not   something   i   would   not   buy   on   dvd .
324848473	15107	3.0	a   fun   well   done   heist   movie .
324848473	15205	3.0	a   well   done   apocalypse   movie ,    and   to   be   honest   i   just   like   dennis   quaid .
324848473	3938	3.0	the   trend   setter   for   animated   action / comedy .
324848473	10928	3.5	funny ,    and   a   breakout   filk   for   carrey .    i   wish   the   second   one   had   been   as   groundbreaking   as   the   first .
324848473	4472	2.0	a   little   too   fluffy   for   me .
324848473	15063	1.0	it   had   its   moments   but   not   really   my   thing .
324848473	16969	4.5	there   are   so   many   damned   layers   to   this   thing   that   i   still   watch   my   copy   to   find   the   meaning .
324848473	13610	5.0	one   of   the   first   truely   well   done   comic   book   franchises .    this   set   the   pace   for   the   genera   after   it   was   floundering   a   bit .
324848473	3962	3.0	another   well   done   cg   flick .
324848473	17324	2.5	better   than   i   expected .
324848473	2463	4.0	a   really   well   done   blending   of   a   cg   and   a   comic   book   flick .    fantastic   voice   cast .
324848473	16879	3.5	sappy   love   story .    sadly   i   actually   like   sappy   love   stories .
324848473	5239	3.0	i   enjoyed   it .    adam   sandler   usually   makes   for   a   good   flick   anyway .
324848473	3860	3.5	enjoyable   and   another   good   non   slapstick   role   for   carrey .    besides
324848473	1962	3.5	a   funny   date   comedy .    the   two   really   went   well   together .
781688248	6736	1.5	with   robin   williams   attached   to   the   project ,    it   should   have   been   a   much   funnier   film .       it   sadly   wasn ['] t .
781688248	16082	5.0	this   is   my   girly   guilty   pleasure .       jennifer   garner   is   absolutely   adorable   in   the   movie !
781688248	7227	4.0	i   enjoyed   it   originally   but   watching   it   for   the   second   time   made   me   think   it   has   lost   its   magic .
781688248	17482	5.0	the   epitome   of   high   school   comedies .       alicia   silverstone   was   absolute   perfection   as   cher   and   it ['] s   a   great   turn   on   jane   austen ['] s    " emma .  "
781688248	16452	5.0	the   imagery   in   the   movie   was   gorgeous   and   mouth - watering ;    i   wish   i   could   eat   everything   onscreen !       and   how   did   they   find   a   little   girl   who   looked   so   much   like   juliette   binoche ?       this   is   a   gem   of   a   movie .
781688248	5496	3.0	no   matter   how   bad   a   film   is ,    will   smith   is   still   my   hero .
781688248	8333	3.5	i   think   the   only   reason   why   i   like   it   so   much   was   because   of   the   company   i   was   with .
781688248	5345	2.5	the   animation   was   poor   and   the   script   was   kinda   dull .
781688248	14822	4.0	the   music   was   by   far   the   best   part   of   the   movie   and   the   animation   reminds   one   of   the   good   old   days   of   disney   princesses .
781688248	468	3.5	better   than   the   second   but   still   far   from   decent .
781688248	6510	5.0	i   love   this   movie   and   it   was   sadly   underrated .       i   guess   bugs   aren ['] t   glamorous   enough   for   hollywood .        :  (
781688248	15063	0.5	i   can ['] t   believe   they   actually   made   this   movie .       they   looked   really   ugly   and   unbelievable   as   girls ,    much   less   pasty   white   girls .       the   jokes   fell   flat   and   the   comedy   just   ended   up   being   sad .
781688248	2136	4.0	a   good   parody   on   teen   movies .       not   as   good   as    " scary   movie ,  "    but   it   was   still   funny .
781688248	15062	5.0	a   fun   movie   with   memorable   songs ,    a   fabulous   cast ,    and   everything   you   could   ever   want   in   a   musical !
781688248	940	4.5	super   fun   to   watch   despite   the   many   inaccuracies   of   greek   mythology .
781688248	15945	3.5	i   loved   it   as   a   child   and   i   probably   would   enjoy   it   still !
781688248	17499	3.5	i   didn ['] t   really   care   for   it   much .       i   like   the   original   story   far   better .
781688248	3962	5.0	such   a   great    " coming - of - age "    story .       all   of   the   characters   were   memorable   and   unique   and   the   cgi   was   amazing .       but   what   would   you   expect   from   pixar ?       nothing   but   the   best !
781688248	2463	5.0	a   pixar   film   about   superheroes ?  ?       it   can   only   be   good !
781688248	7664	1.0	i   didn ['] t   like   it .       it ['] s   overyhyped ,    laughable ,    and   boring .
781688248	13673	5.0	best   pixar   film   to   date .       enough   said .
781688248	2593	5.0	my   favorite !
781688248	14571	4.0	a   very   good   sequel   though   the   cowgirl   was   kinda   annoying .  .  .
781688248	4393	3.0	an   okay   movie   with   a   few   laughs .       the   cartoonish   and   outlandish   humor   just   doesn ['] t   do   it   for   me .
781688248	3414	3.0	it   lacked   the   disney   magic .
781688248	6029	5.0	you   can ['] t   help   but   fall   in   love   with   amelie .    the   presentation   of   the   film   is   quirky   and   sweet .
781688248	758	4.0	possibly   the   only   lindsay   lohan   film   i   can   tolerate .       it ['] s   so   funny   and   satirical   and   very   cute .
781688248	2874	5.0	i   love   this   movie !       it ['] s   a   children ['] s   movie    ( note   the   pg - rating )    so   don ['] t   expect   anything   more   than   gag   jokes   and   kiddie   humor .       it ['] s   still   fun   though ,    ferrell   was   adorable .
781688248	1046	3.0	brittany   murphy   was   kind   of   annoying   but   dakota   fanning   was   good .       too   bad   the   script   couldn ['] t   match   up   to   her   caliber .        :  (
781688248	1962	4.0	a   cute   movie   with   a   flimsy   plot .       drew   barrymore   and   adam   sandler   had   so   much   chemistry   that   they   completely   saved   the   film .
781688248	14050	4.5	i   want   a   golden   ticket !
781688248	5327	2.0	why   did   they   turn   a   classic   into   a   comedy ?       much   less   a   comedy   that   wasn ['] t   even   funny .
781688248	16765	3.0	an   interesting   concept   and   the   actors   did   well   but   after   ten   years   it ['] s   kind   of   cheesy .       it   was   probably   super   awesome   in   the   90s .  .  . not   so   much   now .
781688248	17088	4.5	so   funny ,    i   could   watch   it   over   and   over   again   and   not   ever   get   tired   of   it .
781688248	3427	2.5	definitely   not   as   good   as   the   first .
781688248	1561	1.0	they   should   have   stopped   at   2 .
781688248	12244	4.0	great   acting   in   such   a   sad   story .       jennifer   aniston   finally   proves   herself   as   an   actress ,    yay !       she ['] s   good   at   being   lovable   and   ditzy   but   now   she   shows   that   she   can   do   more   than   just    " friends .  "       and   jake   gyllenhaal   is   as   consistent   as   he   always   is .
781688248	15764	1.5	a   sequel   was   pointless   and   it   was   disappointing   to   see   the   talented   witherspoon   perform   in   such   an   awful   film .
781688248	16879	5.0	i   admit   it ,    i ['] m   a   girl .       i   loved   this   movie .       i   even   like   the   song .       i   can ['] t   help   it .
781688248	3648	4.5	an   absolute   classic .       the   comedy   was   wonderful ,    the   characters   were   brilliant ,    and   who   can   ever   forget   the   voluptuous   jessica   rabbit ?
781688248	5088	5.0	a   romantic   classic   with   some   amazing   moves .       how   can   you   not   swoon ?
781688248	6545	4.0	obviously   it   has   to   be   good   if   martin   scorsese   decided   to   do   an   adaptation .       tony   leung   and   andy   lau   were   absolutely   fabulous !       this   one   is   more   emotion - stricken   than   the   latter   but   i   do   prefer   the   ending   of    " the   departed .  "
781688248	2689	5.0	i   actually   liked   this   more   than   the   bourne   identity .       i   liked   it   a   lot .

835542219	6329	4.0	a   man   with   scissors   for   hands   finds   his   way   into   tim   burton ['] s   vision   of   suburbia .    need   i   say   more ?
835542219	6739	5.0	so   deliciously   old   school   and   incredibly   well - directed .    absolutely   genius   concept   for   its   time ,    as   well .    good   stuff .    gotta   love   hitchcock .
835542219	14869	3.0	great   design ,    detail ,    and   concept .    however ,    there   were   too   many   negatives   to   overcome .    how   come   a   future   movie   feels   like   it   was   set   in   the   past ?    why   does   the   female   lead   suck   at   acting ?    but ,    rutger   hauer   alone   saves   this   movie   from   being   just   another   mediocre   sci - fi   fare .
835542219	3524	5.0	there ['] s   nothing   quite   like   the   film   experience   that   is   pulp   fiction .    tarantino ['] s   writing   at   the   top   of   its   game .
835542219	12870	4.0	i ['] ll   give   spielberg ,    neeson ,    and   kingsley   this .    all   did   a   hell   of   a   job   in   this   film .    the   cinematography   was   especially   phenomenal .    however ,    i   feel   like   this   movie   gets   way   more   credit   than   it   deserves   because   of   its   shock   value .
835542219	5762	4.5	brilliant   writing / direction   from   cameron   crowe ,    and   easily   the   best   rock   and   roll   movie   of   all   time .    anyone   who   knows   rock   history   will   get   a   kick   out   of   a   lot   of   the   things   in   this   movie .
835542219	11173	4.5	a   very   slow ,    but   very   powerful   human   drama .    benicio   del   toro   takes   his   finest   turn   yet   as   the   ever - tortured   jack   jordan .    i   also   loved   the   fragmented   chronology .    that   was   a   nice   touch   as   well .
835542219	1433	5.0	there ['] s   just   something   about   this   movie   that   i   love .    i   think   it ['] s   bogey .
835542219	8327	5.0	i   loved   the   anti - authority   theme   of   the   movie   and   the   fact   that   the   embodiment   of   rebellion   was   none   other   than   jack   nicholson   delivering   one   of   the   finest   performances   of   his   career .
835542219	9628	4.0	although   episode   iv   was   my   favorite ,    vi   comes   very   close .    mainly   because   of   the   ewoks   just   pwning   the   empire .
835542219	3290	4.0	while   this   movie   is ,    like   the   original   godfather ,    a   cinematic   masterpiece .  .  .    i   didn ['] t   enjoy   it   as   much   as   the   first .    which   isn ['] t   a   knock   on   this   film   by   any   means .    it ['] s   real   good   and   i   recommend   it   to   anyone   who   enjoyed   the   first   one .
835542219	6797	4.5	i   love   the   idea   that   drives   this   movie ,    and   i   love   the   characters .    while   i   think   the   whole   thing   was   little   overly   sentimental   and   unrealistic ,    i   think   that ['] s   what   makes   it   great ,    so   i   won ['] t   hate   on   it .    definitely   john   hughes [']    defining   moment .
835542219	13614	5.0	easily   one   of   the   greatest   comedies   ever   made ,    because   many ,    many   people   can   relate   to   the   humor .    not   to   mention ,    it ['] s   just   downright   funny   and   very   well   made .
835542219	17622	4.0	a   heck   of   a   psychological   thriller   which ,    once   it   gets   going ,    keeps   you   guessing   big   time .    the   ending   felt   somewhat   hollywood   but   it   still   ended   up   keeping   up   with   the   artisticness   of   the   rest   of   the   movie   thanks   to   good   direction   by   crowe .    i ['] m   gonna   have   to   re - watch   this   one   to   pick   up   on   the   whole   story .
835542219	872	4.5	gotta   give   credit   where   the   credit   is   due .    this   is   one   hell   of   a   film .    it   can   get   tedious   to   the   average   viewer   at   a   monster   3   1 / 2   hours   but   i ['] d   say   it ['] s   a   must - see   for   any   movie   buff .
835542219	12084	4.0	i   normally   hate   nicolas   cage   but   he   earns   every   accolade   with   this   performance .    also ,    one   of   the   most   ingenious   screenplays   ever   written .    i   swear   one   day ,    i   shall   make   the   3 .
835542219	3756	4.0	one   of   my   favorite   jack   nicholson   performances   and   some   great   direction   from   alexander   payne   really   drive   this   one .    i   love   that   it   can   be   funny   and   sad   at   the   exact   same   time .    p . s .    did   anyone   else   notice   the   subliminal   advertisement   for   sideways ?
835542219	571	5.0	lester   burnham   is   probably   my   favorite   character   of   all   time .    not   to   mention   an   outstanding   script ,    cast ,    and   director   behind   that   fact .    a   great ,    great   movie .
835542219	2452	4.0	sometimes   magnificently   epic ,    sometimes   totally   cheese - tastic .    but   the   good   heavily   outweighs   the   bad   in   this   case .    great   battle   scene   at   the   end   with   boromir   and   all .    i   liked   it .
835542219	7057	4.5	i   really   liked   this   one ,    for   some   reason .    i   think   it   was   just   how   awesome   the   battle   of   helm ['] s   deep   is .    that   has   to   be   one   of   my   favorite   cinema   battles .
835542219	13593	5.0	it ['] s   hard   for   me   to   explain   the   amazingness   of   this   movie   in   so   few   words ,    so   you ['] ll   just   have   to   take   my   word   for   it .    it ['] s   effing   amazing .
835542219	10774	4.0	a   very   good   movie ,    with   one   of   the   most   annoying   soundtracks   i   think   i ['] ve   ever   heard   in   my   entire   life .
835542219	9528	5.0	no   flash   and   bang .    no   car   chases   or   gunshots   fired   here .    it ['] s   black   and   white .    it ['] s   set   in   one   room   expect   for   all   of   3   minutes   of   the   movie .    and   yet   it   is   one   of   the   single   greatest ,    and   most   interesting   films   i   have   ever   seen .
835542219	175	5.0	tarantino ['] s   first   film   is   probably   his   second - best   written   film ,    with   kill   bill   vol .    1   being   the   prime   competition   for   that   spot .    i   highly   recommend   it .
835542219	12161	4.5	far   and   away ,    tim   burton ['] s   best   movie .    it ['] s   like   forrest   gump   meets   the   princess   bride .
835542219	5862	5.0	this   concept   was   a   very   interesting   one ,    and   almost   perfectly   executed   in   this   film .    the   writing   never   seemed   forced ,    the   acting   of   guy   pearce   was   excellent ,    and   the   direction   is   phenomenal .    i   was   hooked   from   the   opening   seconds   and   this   movie   never   lost   my   grasp   until   the   final   scene   had   played   out .
835542219	12293	5.0	what   more   can   i   say   but   give   a   resounding    " two   thumbs   up "    to   this   incredible   achievement   in   cinema ?    an   amazing   film   that   deserves   every   last   accolade   it   receives .
835542219	14550	4.5	started   out   kinda   plain   and   unassuming ,    but   ended   pretty   strong   with   morgan   freeman   taking   the   lead   reins   in   the   end .
835542219	4109	5.0	normally ,    i   hate   horror   movies .    fortunately ,    this   is   more   of   a   comedy   and   a   satire .    i   found   myself   cracking   up   almost   the   entire   way   through .     .  .  .    i   guess   i ['] m .  .  .    well   i   guess   i ['] m   a   pretty   sick   guy .
835542219	16969	5.0	i   just   watched   the   director ['] s   cut   and   it   was .  .    plain   and   simple    -    a   mindfuck .    i ['] ve   never   been   so   confused   as   to   what   was   going   on   in   a   movie   in   my   life .    it ['] s   very   difficult   to   get   your   head   around ,    and   i ['] m   not   quite   sure   it   improves   on   the   original   at   all .  .  .    but   it   was   certainly   interesting   to   try   and   put   the   pieces   together .
835542219	9818	4.5	the   cast   for   this   film   was   basically   pitch   perfect .    spacey ,    crowe   devito ,    and   pearce   all   did   a   great   job   selling   their   characters .    best   cop   movie   i ['] ve   ever   seen   for   sure .

849046953	3290	3.5	best   sequel   ever ?    eh .    that ['] s   only   because   sequels   are   rarely   as   good   or   better .       and   this   isn ['] t   as   good   as   the   first ;    mostly   because   it ['] s   more   of   the   same .       so   yeah ,     " part   2 "    fits   better   than    " 2 "    because   it   just   feels   like   a   continuation   of   the   story .       why   does   it   have   to   end   on   such   a   down   note   though ?       killing   his   brother   and   his   marriage ?       that   and   i   wish   there   was   more   of   young   vito ['] s   story   told .       what   little   glimpses   there   were   were   good   though .
849046953	6989	3.0	i   mean   it ['] s   a   technically   brilliant   art   movie .       but   there ['] s   a   point   where   it   becomes   what   it   is   satirizing .       yes ,    i   get   that   there ['] s   that   underlying   moral ,    but   it   gets   very   underlying   and   redundant   when   there ['] s   people   dying   every   five   minutes .
849046953	3900	4.0	a   car   crash   may   bring   everything   together   in   a   tight   little   knot ,    but   the   underlying   theme   of   dogs   makes   it   irresistible .       three   beautiful   stories   about   love ,    loss ,    and .  .  .    dogs .       love ['] s   a   bitch   indeed .

849046953	16640	3.0	the   characters   are   all   pretty   sad / pathetic   and   funny .       interesting   to   watch ,    but   the   continual   back   and   forth   eventually   just   makes   you   go    " enough   already !  "

592506067	5991	5.0	same   with   this   one .
163663935	14691	3.0	saviour   complex   kind   of   show .  .  .  . the   truth   is ,    the   characters   made   the   show   great   and   the   actors   brought   out   the   characters   to   the   fullest .    but   really ,    who   can   condemn   a   show   with   keenu   reeves   in   it ?
163663935	2985	3.0	the   lameness   of   the   show   is   the   comedy   part .  .  .  . pretty   ok
163663935	15205	4.0	good   storyline ,    good   actors ,    this   show   has   everything .  .  .  . about   when   it   comes   down   to   life   threatening   situations ,    its   being   human   that   will   eventually   save   us   all
163663935	15107	3.0	the   way   the   robeery   went   down   was   executed   brilliantly .  .  .  . the   best   part   of   the   show .  .  .  .
163663935	1905	3.5	anything   with   orlando   bloom   and   johnny   depp   should   be   worth   watching .  .  . and   this   movie   proved   to   be   just   that .  .  .  .  .
163663935	3938	3.5	really   funny   and   hilarious   but   there ['] s   always   room   for   improvement .  .  .
163663935	14103	3.0	i   saw   the   show ,    very   briefly   since   there   were   parts   that   were   considered   too   grown   up   for   my   viewing .    but   it   was   pretty   ok ,    didn ['] t   capture   the   essence   of   the   book   though
163663935	10928	1.5	stupid   movie   with   only   jim   carrey   has   its   driving   force ,    would   never   pay   movie   to   see   it
163663935	17479	3.5	so   scary   i   had   nightmares   for   days .  .  .  . watch   it   at   night   for   best   effect .  .  .  . good   storyline   but   must   listen   to   dialogue .
163663935	6235	2.0	not   very   well   done   compared   to   the   book .  .  .  . the   story   was   there   but   the   characters   weren ['] t   brought   out ,    they   missed   out   on   the   essence   in   nicholas [']    sparks   book ,    which   moved   me   to   tears .  .  .  .
163663935	3962	4.0	as   far   as   cartoons   go ,    this   is   one   of   the   best .  .  .  . comedy   and   raw   emotion   makes   it   a   must   watch
163663935	2457	3.0	well ,    i ['] m   a   sucker   for   love   stories   so   this   one   was   pretty   ok   for   me .
163663935	17324	4.5	this   is   show   is   that   gd .  .  .  . i   have   been   quoting   from   it   ever   since .  .  .  .
163663935	6287	4.5	any   movie   with   richard   gere   in   it ,    i   am   a   fan .  .  .  . but   the   combination   and   the   chemistry   is   great !    sort   of   the   modern   day   cinderella   story .
163663935	7032	3.0	quite   ok ,    though   not   as   gd   as   the   first   2 ,    pretty   funny   and   beyonce   is   a   sexy   mama !
163663935	3860	3.0	the   more   times   u   watch ,    the   more   u   get   its   humour ,    its   goood !
163663935	758	3.0	it   shows   just   what   goes   on   in   high   sch   and   what   happenes   when   we   let   rules   and   popularity   guide   us .    the   reality   about   it   is   great .  .  .  .
163663935	3579	1.0	this   is   a   pity   point   cos   this   movie   is   that   bad .    eva   mendes   and   palk   walker   have   no   chemistry   whatsoever   and   paul   walker   goes   around   saying   idiotic   things   like   bro .  .  .
163663935	1962	3.0	the   perfect   date   movie   which   proves   that   there   is   the   right   person   for   everyone
803223085	5705	3.5	pretty   good   great   memorable   moments   to   it

343147305	10928	4.5	ha !    this   is   a   classic !    jim   carrey   at   his   best !    i   crack   up   every   time   i   watch   this .     " lets   see   that   in   instant   replay !  "
343147305	7521	2.5	rather   funny   but   also   rather   dodgy .    i   think   i ['] d   have   enjoyed   it   more   if   i ['] d   seen   some   of   the   movies   it   parodied
343147305	8038	3.0	i   don ['] t   remember   watching   this ,    but   im   sure   i   have
343147305	6235	3.5	this   is   a   great   and   very   touching   movie ,    i   especially   liked   the   fact   that   its   a   movie   about   a   christian   and   how   she   is   portrayed   in   the   movie .
343147305	13610	4.0	this   was   a   good   movie ,    definately   did   justice   to   the   character   of   spiderman
343147305	10583	3.5	i   liked   this   movie ,    i   thought   some   of   the   music   in   it   was   really   awesome   and   overall   it   was   a   pretty   good   movie
343147305	7635	4.5	funny   movie !    i   loved   it !     " loud   noises !  "
343147305	17324	3.5	im   quite   a   will   smith   fan ,    and   i   enjoyed   watching   him   in   hitch .    although   it   was   predictable ,    it   was   still   good   to   watch
343147305	16879	2.0	an   ok   movie ,    bit   dodgy   at   points .    probably   wouldnt   watch   it   again
343147305	11337	2.0	funny   but   so   dodgy   that   i   didnt   like   it
343147305	7032	3.0	funny   movie ,    not   bad   for   a   second   sequel   but   also   rather   dodgy .  .  .

343147305	5239	3.0	pretty   good   adam   sandler   movie ,    not   the   worst   but   also   not   my   fav
343147305	3860	4.0	another   great   jim   carrey   movie .    it   definatley   doesnt   potray   christianity   or   god   in   a   bad   light   and   is   very   entertaining   to   watch
343147305	758	4.0	i   really   enjoyed   watching   this   movie ,    great   story ,    good   humour   and   characters .

368575064	6099	3.5	bit   to   long ,    some   great   moments   but   drags   towards   the   end .       i   am   talking   about   the   redux   version
368575064	4402	4.0	dated   a   tad   now   but   i   remember   watching   it   when   i   was   younger
368575064	16203	3.0	nearly   as   good   as   the   first

368575064	13418	3.5	not   a   patch   on   the   first
368575064	9960	5.0	yes   yes   yes
368575064	3533	4.0	all   sorts   of   funny
368575064	3938	4.5	just   as   good   as   the   first
368575064	14103	4.0	reminds   me   of   being   in   love ,    i   miss   that   feeling ,    quite   sad   film .
368575064	7521	4.5	best   of   the   bunch ,    the   rest   got   stupid
368575064	406	3.0	could   of   been   better   but   worth   a   watch
368575064	673	4.5	there   is   not   much   more   i   can   say   then   this   is   a   film   like   no   other .    entertaining ,    thought   provoking ,    and   superbly   directed .    the   end   has   a   fantastic   twist   which   makes   the   film   a   definite   re - watch .    you   need   to   own   this   film !
368575064	6989	1.5	what   was   all   the   hype   about ?
368575064	17499	3.0	eddie   murphy   makes   this   film
368575064	3151	3.0	after   all   the   hype   i   picked   this   movie   up   for   a   bargain   that   was    £ 5   but   having   watched   it   i   wish   i   just   borrowed   it   instead .       the   film   had   it ['] s   moments   but   they   were   short   lived   and   very   far   apart .
368575064	2186	5.0	funny   and   action   packed ,    who   would   of   thought   that   will   smith   and   martin   lawrence   would   of   made   such   a   great   partnership .

368575064	758	3.5	quite   good ,    better   then   i   thought   it   would   be
368575064	16008	4.0	your   the   best
368575064	7057	4.5	all   the   best   bits   of   the   book   were   moved   to   return   of   the   king   but   that   does   not   stop   it   being   an   incredible   film .       extended   version   better   then   the   original
368575064	17426	5.0	my   fave   childhood   story
368575064	2874	4.0	not   as   funny   as   i   thought   it   would   be   but   that   didnt   matter   as   it   was   a   good   all   round   family   christmas   film .
368575064	2776	3.0	could   of   been   better
368575064	14960	3.0	nothing   special
368575064	5401	4.5	i   love   this   film ,    much   of   my   sense   of   humour .       stiller ? s   character   is   brilliant   and   very   funny .       plus   i   got   to   learn   a   little   more   about   the   rules   of   dodgeball .       the   training   they   go   through   before   playing   a   game   is   hilarious .       this   is   a   film   i   will   come   back   to   and   watch   again   and   again .

511336126	16790	3.5	a   classic   story   wise   but   jim   takes   it   with   performance   it   would   have   taken   ages   to   get   that   stuff   on

469108318	14528	3.5	first   off ,    i   can ['] t   remember   the   last   time   i   laughed   so   much   while   watching   a   movie .    napoleon   dynamite ,    maybe .    this   harkens   back   to   the   monster   flicks   of   the    ['] 50s ,    where   there   was   always   some   kind   of   atomic   accident ,    or   radiation   leak   that   caused   some   horrible   mutation   in   one   animal   or   another .    such   is   the   case   with   the   spiders   in   eight   legged   freaks .    there ['] s   a   cannister   of   toxic   waste   spilled   into   a   pond ,    and   we   end   up   with   mutated   giant   spiders   on   a   rampage !    i   was   liking   this   very   much ,    right   up   until   the   first   appearance   of   the   spiders   en   masse ,    where   they ['] re   chasing   down   the   teenagers   on   dirtbikes .    i ['] m   sorry ,    but   the   way   the   spiders   are   leaping   and   hopping   through   the   air   brought   back   painful   memories   of   the   hulk .    they   just   do   not   look   real .    however ,    that   having   been   said ,    from   the   moment   one   of   the   giant   spiders   crawls   through   scarlett   johansson ['] s   bedroom   window ,    and   cocoons   both   her   and   david   arquette   to   the   wall ,    this   thing   kicks   into   high   gear   and   basically   never   lets   up .    there   are   laughs   a - plenty   as   the   film   pays   homage   to   dawn   of   the   dead ,    when   the   townspeople   barricade   themselves   inside   a   mall ,    and   aliens ,    when   they   discover   people   cocooned   in   a   mine   underneath   the   town .    and   despite   my   previous   complaint ,    there   is   some   excellent   cgi   work   in   the   film ,    most   notably   when   a   passel   of   spiders   are   crawling   across   the   mall   ceiling ,    when   they ['] re   climbing   up   a   communications   antenna   on   the   mall   roof ,    and   again   in   the   climactic   scene   in   the   mine ,    when   they ['] re   swarming   like   locusts   along   the   walls .    but ,    even   though   this   is   basically   a   monster   flick ,    the   spiders   are   not   really   the   stars .    that ['] s   due   to   the   very   effective   performances   of   the   humans   in   the   cast ,    especially   kari   wuhrer   as   sam   parker ,     ['] the   sexiest   sheriff   in   the   whole   country [']    and   david   arquette   as   the   son   of   a   deceased   mine   owner ,    who   has   just   returned   to   town .    good   timing !    also   quite   good   are   scarlett   johansson   as   the   sheriff ['] s   daughter ,    and   scott   terra   as   her   son ,    the   young   arachnid   expert   who   first   tries   to   warn   people   about   the   spider   problem .    if   you ['] re   able   to   get   past   some   of   the   cheesier   special   effects ,    and   just   laugh   along   with   it ,    this   is   a   pretty   entertaining   film .
469108318	12102	4.5	when   i   first   saw   this ,    i   was   so   blown   away   that   it   was   the   only   movie   i   wanted   to   watch   for   weeks .    it ['] s   a   rock   musical   that   tells   the   story   of   hansel / hedwig ,    a   young    ['] person [']    from   east   berlin   who   marries   an   american   soldier   and   moves   to   the   united   states .    there ,    hedwig   meets   and   forms   a   songwriting   partnership   with   a   young   man ,    who   eventually   leaves   and   uses   their   songs   to   rise   to   superstardom   as   tommy   gnosis ,    while   hedwig   is   relegated   to   touring   really   small   venues    ( mostly   a   restaurant   chain   called   bilgewater ['] s )    with   his / her   band   the   angry   inch .    writer / director / star   john   cameron   mitchell   is   simply   sensational   as   hedwig ,    and   when   you   consider   the   fact   that   this   was   his   directorial   debut ,    it ['] s   even   more   amazing .    it ['] s   funny ,    it ['] s   heartbreaking ,    the   songs   are   fantastic ,    and   the   animation   is   really   cool ,    too !    dismissing   this   as   merely   a    ['] gay [']    film   would   be   like   dismissing   lawrence   of   arabia   because   it ['] s   about   sand .
469108318	15425	5.0	so   much   has   been   written   about   this   movie   on   flixster   and   elsewhere ,    that   there ['] s   really   not   a   lot   more   to   be   said .    and   it   is   almost   10   years   old ,    after   all .    but   the   beauty   of   the   big   lebowski   is   that   the   more   you   watch   it ,    the   more   you   appreciate   its   brilliance .    that ['] s   probably   why   people   are   still   talking   about   it   after   all   these   years .    it   never   seems   to   get   old .    the   plot   itself   is   really   not   all   that   original ,    but   it ['] s   what   the   coens   do   with   it   that   makes   it   so   special .    they   may   have   written   the   funniest   screenplay   ever ,    and   the   casting   is   perfect .    it ['] s   impossible   to   picture   anyone   else   playing   the   dude ,    walter ,    maude ,    donny   or   jesus ,    and   they   all   deliver   their   outrageous   lines   as   if   they   were   born   to   speak   them .    and   how   about   all   those   dream   sequences   and   acid   flashbacks ?    who   can   forget   the   scene   where   the   dude   is   flying   through   the   air   with   a   goofy   stoner   grin   on   his   face ,    when   suddenly   a   bowling   ball   appears   in   his   hand ,    causing   him   to   drop   like   a   stone .    or   the   scene   where   he ['] s   levitating   down   the   bowling   lane   between   the   legs   of   the   viking   women ,    or   whatever   the   hell   they ['] re   supposed   to   be .    brilliant !    there   are   so   many   fantastic   scenes   and   quotable   lines ,    and   all   the   characters   have   their   own   little   idosyncrasies ,    especially   the   dude .    the   dude   is   a   walking   idiosyncrasy !    anyway ,    there ['] s   a   hell   of   a   lot   to   wrap   your   head   around ,    and   i   haven ['] t   even   mentioned   the   music ,    which   is   great ,    and   perfectly   suited   to   the   movie .    the   big   lebowski   is   truly   one   of   a   kind .    fargo   may   be   a   better   film ,    but   this   one   is   really   in   a   class   by   itself .    aren ['] t   you   glad   there   wasn ['] t   a   lot   more   to   be   said ?

99042777	3938	3.0	i   like   the   first   one   better ,    but   this   one   wasnt   to   bad ,    but   i   still   say   stick   with   the   original !
99042777	14103	4.0	this   was   really   romantic ,    i   really   liked   it
99042777	15063	3.0	this   wasnt   too   bad ,    its   been   a   while   since   i   saw   it ,    but   it   was   alright
99042777	10928	3.0	i   have   seen   this   one ,    i   didnt   find   this   one   as   funny   as   the   first    ,    the   first   one   was   pretty   good !    nobody   can   bet   those   devil   horns   of   the   white   devil !
99042777	17479	3.0	wasnt   as   scary   as   people   were   making   it   out   to   be .  .  .
99042777	13610	2.0	i   did   enjoy   this   one   when   it   first   came   out ,    but   now   its   not   that   great   to   me .    i   have   seen   alot   better .  .  . i   say   stick   with   the   cartoons !
99042777	10583	3.0	this   was   kind   of   a   disappointment   actuarlly ,    i   guess   i   was   really   really   looking   foward   to   seeing   it   because   of   how   good   the   trailers   looked ,    but   it   just   wasnt   what   i   was   expecting ,    but   i   did   enjoy   it   though .  .  . just   a   bit   disappointed
99042777	3962	4.0	i   like   dis   one ,    i   like   animations   of   fish   with   a   10   second   memory   span .  .  .  : d
99042777	17324	4.0	this   was   pretty   good ,    i   really   enjoyed   it ,    so   funny !
99042777	2463	3.0	i   didnt   enjoy   this   one   as   much   as   i   would   have   thought ,    not   one   of   my   fav .
99042777	7664	3.0	i   have   only   seen   this   one   a   couple   of   times ,    though   the   few   times   i   have   seen   it ,    i   have   only   seen   it   the   whole   way   through   once .  .  . i   did   enjoy   it ,    but   i   dont   fully   remember   it    ( i   saw   it   a   long   time   ago !  !  !  !  !  )
99042777	10820	5.0	i   dont   think   i   will   ever   get   sick   of   back   to   the   future !
99042777	7032	3.0	its   been   a   while   since   i   saw   this   one ,    i   think   my   dad   and   i   went   and   saw   it   at   the   movies   when   it   first   came   out
99042777	3860	4.0	i   do   really   enjoy   this ,    i   enjoy   alot   of   movies   with   jim   carrey   in   them ,    and   this   is   just   another   one   to   add   to   the   list
99042777	3138	4.0	its   the   only   one   i   have   seen ,    but   i   thought   it   was   great !
99042777	12471	2.0	i   used   to   like   eminem ,    and   even   then   i   didnt   really   enjoy   this   movie
99042777	1962	4.0	this   was   pretty   good ,    i   really   enjoyed   this ,    it   was   stupid .  .  . which   makes   it   so   great !
821471492	6434	5.0	a   just   plain   well   made   film .       everything   was   done   well   from   the   work   of   the   people   behind   the   camera   to   every   member   of   the   cast .
821471492	16384	4.0	not   a   great   adaptation   of   the   series   but   still   a   very   good   film .
821471492	16516	1.5	good   start   but   a   bad   ending .       only   watch   this   if   you   can   follow   it   immediately   by   the   sequel .
821471492	17330	4.5	good   adaptation   of   marvel ['] s   newer ,    more    " real "    version   of   the   classic   character .
821471492	16668	1.5	painfully   overrated   and   far   too   over - quoted .
821471492	10168	4.0	poor   adaptation   but   fun   film .       the   performances   are   quite   good   but   the   action   does   periodically   get   silly ,    even   for   a   fantasy .
821471492	17335	5.0	my   personal   favorite   film .       film   making   years   ahead   of   it ['] s   time .
821471492	17187	5.0	often   over - hyped   but   not   to   be   missed   holiday   classic .
821471492	13248	4.5	smarter   than   most   have   given   it   credit .
821471492	5477	4.0	schwarzenegger   and   devito   have   great   chemistry   that   would   upgrade   anything   they   work   on   together .
821471492	3414	3.5	o . k .  ,    so   it   has   no   real   connection   to   the   actual   pocahontas   story   but   it   is   an   entertaining   film .
821471492	9368	5.0	you   don ['] t   need   a   big   budget   to   create   a   good ,    creepy   horror   movie .       the   best   horror   films   keep   the   viewers   on   edge   until   the   credits   role ,    and   that   is   certainly   the   case   here .
821471492	3817	5.0	looked   bad   on   paper ,    but   surprisingly   excellent !       i   can   watch   it   a   hundred   times    ( and   almost   have )    without   getting   bored   of   it .
821471492	2992	4.0	fun   but   try   not   to   take   it   too   seriously .
821471492	7267	4.0	the   millionth   version   of   the   gunfight   at   the   o . k .    corral   has   much   of   the   usual   hollywood   trappings   but   is   more   accurate   that   most   of   the   others .
821471492	28	5.0	i   didn ['] t   realize   just   how   much   i   would   like   this   film   even   when   the   ads   for   a   disney   film   featured   the   music   of   ac / dc .
821471492	11132	2.0	ermey ['] s   performance   and   some   good   violence   save   this   remake   but   the   chills   and   creepiness   are   gone   as   well   as   the   feeling   of   isolation   that   fueled   much   of   the   fear   in   the   original .
821471492	15200	4.0	a   bit   goofy ,    but   entertaining .
821471492	16825	4.0	i   was   skeptical   about   anyone   stepping   into   gardner ['] s   shoes   in   this   role   but   it   turned   out   quite   well .
821471492	312	1.5	typical   hollywood    " relationship   gets   better   because   guy   cheats   on   girl   and   then   wins   her   back "    story .       i   couldn ['] t   care   enough   about   any   of   the   characters   to   care   what   happens   to   any   of   them .
821471492	5596	3.5	would   have   been   better   without   one   painful   story   element   at   the   beginning .
821471492	12034	3.5	i   liked   this   film   a   lot   more   when   i   saw   it   on   the   big   screen   as   it   was   meant   to   be   seen   but   it   still   needed   to   be   longer   so   that   the   break   down   of   jack   torrance   would   make   more   sense .
821471492	6556	2.0	interesting   idea ,    poorly   realized .
821471492	4670	3.5	bad   remake   of   the   t . v .    series   but   a   fun   film .
821471492	14531	5.0	highly   recommended !
821471492	6428	4.5	good   adaptation   of   the   novel .
821471492	1307	4.0	starts   clumsy   but   ends   well .
821471492	7227	5.0	one   of   the   best   comic   book   adaptations   made .       basically   because   the   film - makers   were   loyal   to   the   original   material .
821471492	10231	5.0	part   live   action   cartoon   and   part   tribute   to   kung   fu   films ,    chow   has   created   a   wonderfully   entertaining   film .
821471492	7219	4.0	once   again   hollywood   takes   liberties   with   history   but   it   is   a   good   film   with   fine   performances .
821471492	6268	4.5	could   have   used   less   over - used   family   strife   but   it   is   still   very   entertaining .       oldman ['] s   smith   steals   the   show   here   just   as   jonathan   harris [']    smith   did   in   the   original .
821471492	7356	4.0	better   version   of   armageddon .
821471492	4931	3.0	i   didn ['] t   find   this   film   as   bad   as   it ['] s   reputation   suggests .       it   seems   the   victim   of    " jump   on   the   bandwagon "    type   criticism .
821471492	2252	1.0	there   have   been   many   versions   of   the   dracula   story   and   i   would   have   had   little   problem   with   this   film   if   it   had   not   claimed   to   be    " bram   stoker ['] s "    dracula .       coppola   strays   away   from   the   novel   far   more   than   he   follows   it .       plus ,    it   has   the   usual   over - the - top   hollywood   style   that   sacrifices   substance   for   style .
821471492	14646	4.0	gwynne   steals   the   show   here   and   gives   a   brilliant   reading   of   one   of   the   best   tag   lines   in   recent   film   history ,     " sometimes ,    dead   is   better .  "
821471492	14280	3.5	the   charisma   and   chemistry   of   newman   and   redford   is   really   what   this   film   is   about .       the   story   is   secondary .
821471492	14042	4.0	imaginative   but   the   story   could   have   been   tightened   up   a   bit .
821471492	8881	5.0	i   just   plain   love   this   film .
821471492	4216	4.0	i   didn ['] t   think   that   they   could   get   a   third   good   film   out   of   the   same   set   up   but   they   did .
821471492	3254	3.5	affleck   was   better   than   expected   but   ferrell   steals   every   scene   he ['] s   in .       flawed   but   not   a   bad   adaptation .          the   director ['] s   cut   is   better .
821471492	6908	3.5	weakest   of   the   films   with   the   original   cast ,    it   still   has   several   good   moments   and   only   really   suffers   when   compared   to   the   fine   quality   of   the   others .       plays   less   like   a   film   and   more   like   a   big   budget   episode   of   the   series .
821471492	15151	4.0	more    " inspired   by "    than   a   remake ,    this   film   turned   out   quite   well .
821471492	13651	5.0	top - notch   action   thriller   with   great   action   and   performances .
821471492	3385	4.0	good   film   but   the   photography   didn ['] t   work   well   on   the   big   screen .
821471492	12682	5.0	easily   one   of   the   best   modern   horror   films   with   fine   performances   by   virginia   madsen   and   tony   todd .
821471492	10886	3.5	this   is   a   fun   film   as   long   as   you   don ['] t   take   it   too   seriously .
821471492	10282	4.0	not   a   good   remake   of   the   japanese   classic   but   if   you   can   ignore   that ,    it ['] s   actually   a   fun   film .
821471492	14313	4.0	though   only   loosely   based   on   history ,    it   is   an   entertaining   tale   even   when   the   style   gets   a   bit   heavy - handed .
821471492	17703	4.5	the   hulk   looks   a   little   to    " cartoon "    like   and   the   end   seems   a   bit   anti - climatic ,    but   the   performances   are   good   and   ang   lee   brings   a   great   deal   of   humanity   to   the   film .

780491349	290	4.0	this   movie   feels   like   a   group   of   guys   sat   in   a   circle   and   played   the    " d ['] ya   know   what   would   be   funny ?

780491349	17050	4.5	i   studied   this   film   for   a   paper   i   wrote ,    so   i   have   an   obsessive   appreciation   for   it .       i ['] m   still   deathly   afraid   of   the   wheelers .
780491349	2112	1.0	i   have   nightmares   based   on   and   about   this   movie   because   of   it .       i   liked   it   until   the   end .

780491349	11218	5.0	yes ,    it ['] s   schmaltzi ,    but   i   love   it   even   to   this   day .       this   movie   is   light   and   fun   and   reminds   me   of   how   i   always   imagined   my   childhood   even   during   it .       i   could   find   myself   in   each   of   the   four   girls   and   even   adopted   their   style   of   dress   for   a   while .
780491349	11781	3.5	i   refused   to   see   this   for   almost   fifteen   years   because   i   had   heard   bad   things   and   didn ['] t   want   to   break   the   spell   that   the   indiana   jones   movies   has   on   me .       i   decided   to   watch   it   before   the   new   movie   came   out   and   now   can   understand   why   others   warned   me   from   it .       if   the   films   had   been   shot   and   shown   in   chronological   order ,    i   don ['] t   think   i   would   have   continued   with   the   series   based   on   this   one .       i   can ['] t   even   put   my   finger   on   what   feels   off    ( lots   of   people   have   tried ,    i   know )  ,    but   everything   from   the   tone ,    the   structure ,    the   tempo ,    etc .    seem   different   from   raiders   and   last   crusade .       an   extra   star - and - a - half   simply   because   it ['] s   an   indy   movie .
780491349	11468	3.0	i   liked   the   twist   at   the    * very *    end ,    but   i   couldn ['] t   get   into   it   otherwise   because   i   kept   being   reminded   of   the   1970s   remake   of    _ the   big   sleep _    and   how   angry   i   was   at   myself   that   i   rented   that   by   accident   instead   of   the   original    .     .     .    and   then   another   five   minutes   would   have   gone   by   in   layer   cake ,    and   i   wouldn ['] t   really   care   that   much   that   i   had   spaced   out   for   so   long .
780491349	2992	3.0	here ['] s   how   this   movie   was   described   to   me :        " so ,    vin   diesel    ( or   maybe   it   was   the   rock )    lives   in   la ,    and   he ['] s   in   charge   of   getting   stuff   back   for   people .       so ,    he   gets   sent   to   the   jungle   to   get   back   this   rich   kid   who ['] s   hiding   there   and   trying   to   find   this   treasure   thing .       so ,    then   he ['] s   in   the   jungle ,    and   he   goes   to   this   town   that   christopher   walken    ( but   it   might   have   been   jon   voigt )    owns ,    and   rosario   dawson   is   there .  "       this   is   where   i   cut   her   off   and   said ,     " you ['] re   making   this   up   as   you   go   along ,    aren ['] t   you ?  "       nope -  - the   description   was   fairly   accurate    ( minus   the   actor - confusion )  ,    but   i   wound   up   with   a   really   twisted   picture   in   my   head   going   into   it .
780491349	658	2.0	i   saw   this   when   it   first   came   out   in   theaters ,    and   i   was   bored ,    but   i   reeeeeeeeally   wanted   to   learn   to   play    " everything   i   do "    on   the   piano   and   did -  - quite   poorly .

781899228	3524	5.0	this   film   had   everything .    it   had   action    ( a   great   one   at   that )  ,    romance ,    comedy    ( again .  .    a   great   one   at   that )  ,    drama .    it   had   most   of   the   genres .    it   has   a   fantastic   screenplay .    the   dialog   was   very   intriguing   and   memorable .    this   one   is   one   of   my   top   3   movies .    when   i   first   saw   it   i   feel   in   love   with   it .

781899228	14691	4.0	this   movie   revolutionized   special   effects .    great   fresh   special   effects   and   a   very   interesting   storyline .
781899228	16793	3.5	i   remember   looking   at   the   universal   studios   map   and   seeing   possessed   regan ['] s   face   on   the   map .    i   was   terrified   as   a   child   looking   at   it ,    it   gave   me   nightmares !    though   i   never   really   had   the   chance   to   actually   watch   the   movie   until      i   was   about   16 .    i   have   always   heard   that   this   was   one   of   the   scariest   movies .    this   movie   had   no   effect   me    ( besides   the   random   pop   up   images   of   that   face   of   course )  .    this   movie   was   definitely   good   for   its   time .    and   nowadays   a   whole   bunch   of   scary   movies   come   out   that   make    ['] the   exorcist [']    seem   like   a   g - rated   movie .    this   film   had   some   good   acting   and   an   interesting   storyline   anyways .    probably   if   i   watched   the   movie   as   a   child   i   would   have   been   terrified .
781899228	2862	3.5	maybe   it   was   because   i   had   high   expectations   again ,    but   i   didn ['] t   think   that   this   movie   was   one   of   the   greatest   movies   ever   made .    i   felt   it   was   really   overrated .    anthony   hopkins   was   perfect   for   lecter .    i   mean   he   won   an   academy   award   even   when   he   had   around   7   minutes   of   screen - time .    that   is   pretty   impressive .
781899228	3938	4.0	shrek   2   was   just   as   good   as   the   first   one .  .    if   not   better !    my   favourite   scenes   was   the    " knights "    scene .    tht   pepperspray   was   classic !    hahah .    if   you   loved   the   first   one ,    definitely   check   this   out !
781899228	14103	4.5	hahaha   i   loved   this   movie .    i   remembered   that   girls   always   talked   about   this   movie   in   school .  .    now   i   know   why    :  )  .
781899228	15063	1.5	the   only   thing   worth   watching   in   this   movie   are   terry   crews   scenes .    they   were   priceless !     .  .    besides   those   3   minutes ,    you ['] re   not   missing   much .
781899228	10451	5.0	another   of   my   favourites .    i   love   the   kind   of   the   movies   where   you   hate   the   protagonist ['] s   guts   but   you   later   that   changes   and   you   have   sympathy   for   them   or   you   just   love   the   character   period .    this   movie   very   twisted ,    but   it   all   worked   out   well .    malcolm   mcdowell   played   the   part   well   and   it   still   and   always   will   be   a   classic !
781899228	673	5.0	superb   movie !    the   ending   is   phenomenal .    the   music ,    the   writing ,    the   characters ,    all   top - notch .    it   had   it ['] s   comedic   moments   and   it   had   it ['] s   dark   moments .    highly   recommended .
781899228	17479	2.0	i   thought   this   movie   was   overrated .    it   was   not   scary   at   all !
781899228	17335	4.5	i   am   still   amazed   at   the   special   effects   that   were   done   in   this   80   year   old   movie .    not   only   did   i   think   they   were   amazing ,    but   i   thought   that   it   was   far   ahead   of   its   time .    the   sets ,    the   camera   work ,    the   music .  .    everything !    i   was   highly   entertained .
781899228	17324	4.5	will   smith   and   kevin   james   are   such   a   fantastic   comedic   duo .    i   laughed   out   loud   at   the   scenes   they   shared .    the   plot   was   very   interesting   also .
781899228	16640	5.0	this   my   favourite   romance   movie .    the   script   had   lots   of   fantastic   witty   dialog   that   made   me   interesting   in   seeing   the   original   play .    high   quality   acting   for   all   actors   and   actresses   in   this   movie .    but   clive   owen   stood   out   above   all .    i   have   memorized   some   of   the   lines   from   various   scenes   because   they   just   stuck   in   my   head .    it   was   so   well   done .    i   fell   in   love   with   all   four   of   the   main   characters   in   this   movie . plus   the   music .  .    damian   rice ['] s    " the   blower ['] s   daughter "    was   so   perfect   for   this   movie .    it   was   poetic   and   sad .
781899228	5239	4.0	i   found   this   to   be   better   than   most   romantic - comedies   that   are   out   nowadays .    it   really   had   an   intriguing   plot   and   i   loved   the   ending !
781899228	571	5.0	my   favourite / 2nd   favourite .    this   movie   had   everything   also .    it   is   one   of   the   few ,    if   not   only   movies   that   i   have   watched   again   after   viewing   it   the   first   time   because   it   was   just   too   darn   good !    this   movie   made   me   laugh   and   cry .    such   a   memorable   film .    kevin   spacey   was   perfect   for   this   role .
781899228	8295	4.0	this   was   another   great   movie   with   a   great   soundtrack .    shia   labeouf   is   going   to   become   a   really   great   and   respected   actor   one   day .    this   movie   made   me   what   to   read   the   book .    this   was   a   very   fun   movie   to   watch .
781899228	175	4.0	great   movie ,    great   dialogue    ( as   always   from   tarantino )  ,    memorable   scenes ,    suspenseful   ending .    i      love   this   movie ,    but   after   watching   it   a   few   times   and   overtime   i   grew   out   of   it   a   little .    it ['] s   still   a   good   movie ,    but   it ['] s   just   not   one   of   those   movies   where   i   would   watch   again   and   again .
781899228	11077	4.0	one   of   the   best   comedy   sequels   out   there .    it ['] s   hard   to   decide   which   was   one   better / funnier .    both   movies   were   hilarious    :  )  .
781899228	17506	4.0	this   is   another   movie   that   i   thought   was   going   to   suck .    i   was   actually   surprised   once   again .    it   was   a   pretty   cute   and   funny   movie .    the   ending   caught   me   off   guard   too .
781899228	9049	5.0	if   you   were   to   ask   me   to   find   at   least   one   thing   that   i   did   no   like   about   this   film .    i   would   have   some   difficulty ,    because   this   movie   is   perfection   in   its   own   way .    almost   all   the   characters   were   lovable ,    the   rest   were   characters   that   were   meant   to   be   not   liked .    colourful   and   lively   cast   that   represented   intriguing   characters .    it   is   hard   to   decide   which   character   is   my   favourite .    the   music   that   was   played   in   the   movie   just   fitted   in   so   well !    it   was   interesting   seeing   the    " bright "    side   and   later   the   dark - side   of   the   porno   industry .    how   all   the   characters   deal   with   their   consequences .  ['] boogie   nights [']    is   one   of   my   top   10   favourite   movies .
781899228	6531	5.0	i ['] m   not   sure ,    i   think   when   it   comes   to   adam   sandler ,    i   prefer   him   in   drama   movies   over   comedy .    his   performance   in    ['] punch - drunk   love [']    felt   so   real .    the   scene   with   adam   sandler   and   philip   seymour   hoffman   on   the   phone   is   one   of   my   favourite   scenes   in   a   movie .
781899228	2590	3.5	i ['] m   not   that   big   on   musicals .    but   there   was   a   great   cast .    the   songs   were   alright ,    i   couldn ['] t   really   get   into   them .    but   i   was   really   into   the   storyline   and   the   twists   and   turns   of   a   historical   event   into   a   musical .    this   originally   was   intended   to   not   be   a   musical   but   strictly   a   drama .    hmm ,    how   different   would   that   have   been .
781899228	3905	4.0	" the   others "    is   one   bone - chilling   movie .    i   totally   did   not   see   the   ending   coming .    this   had   a   really   great   twist .
781899228	4109	3.5	this   movie   was   quite   the   weird   black   comedy .    christian   bale   fit   the   part   so   well .    from   his   narration   about   his   morning   routine   to   his   monologue   about   huey   lewis .     " to   hip   to   be   square !  "
781899228	13302	4.5	a   movie   that   definitely   cannot   be   made   today .    this   film   was   not   afraid   to   poke   at   racism .    it   shows   how   ridiculous   racism   is .    and   at   the   same   time   it   is   a   hilarious   comedy   from   mel   brooks .    sweet   deal !  " excuse   me   while   i   whip   this   out !  .  .  "  * gasp *
781899228	12034	4.5	there   are   a   very   few   horror   movies   that   actually   made   me   frightened   and   this   is   one   of   them .    towards   the   ending   i   was   on   the   edge   of   my   seat !    it   was   very   suspenseful .    i   do   not   think   there   is   any   other   person   who   could   play   the   character    ['] jack   torrance [']    better   than   jack   nicholson !
781899228	17293	0.5	and   i   thought   the   ring   was   bad .  .    this   movie   is   possibly   the   worst   movie   i   have   seen .    i   was   getting   so   bored   while   i   was   watching   this .
781899228	6556	4.5	a   very   weird   movie ,    but   in   a   good   way .    it   was   an   interesting   take   on   my   favourite   play .    it   had   a   great   all - star   cast   and   everyone   fitted   the   role   perfectly .    leonardo   dicaprio ['] s   interpretation   of   romeo   was   a   huge   inspiration   of   how   i   played   romeo   in   my   high   school   play .    the   music !    one   of   the   best   soundtracks   i   have   ever   heard .    i   absolutely   love   every   song .    this   movie   never   gets   old ,    and   it   is   such   a   fun   movie   to   watch ! harold   perrineau   as   mercutio ,    quite   possibly   the   best   casting   choice   ever ?     : dromeo   represent !     ;  )
781899228	887	3.5	i   saw   this   one   the   airplane   haha .    it   was   actually   pretty   good   haha .
781899228	4472	4.5	one   of   my   favourite   romance - comedies .    there   are   so   many   lovable   characters   in   this   movie .    there   has   to   be   at   least   one   character   you   could   relate   too .    i   was   never   interested   in   hugh   grant ,    until   i   saw   this   movie .    i   loved   the   entire   cast ,    and   rowan   atkinson ['] s   scene   was   a   classic   hahaha !    but   not   only   was   the   movie   too   funny ,    it   was   also   very   touching   and   sweet .    i ['] m   not   that   into   chic   flicks ,    but   this   is   in   an   exception .  .    in   fact ,    i   wouldn ['] t   really   consider   this   a   chic   flick   entirely .
781899228	10928	4.0	i   remember   watching   this   movie   all   the   time   as   a   kid .    it ['] s   still   is   funny   to   me   today .
781899228	15233	1.0	i   laughed   once .    this   movie   was   painful   to   watch .
781899228	2136	4.5	this   is   my   favourite   parody   movie ,    hands   down !    i   love   the   amount   of   clicheness   it   makes   fun   of .
781899228	15471	4.5	this   movie   is   very   intense .    the   plot   and   twists   all   work   together   smoothly .
781899228	7691	4.0	i   enjoyed   this   movie .    leonard   whiting   and   olivia   hussey   obviously   had   great   chemistry   in   the   movie .    they   were   perfect   for   each   other .    though   this   movie   portray   the   play   they   way   it   was   meant   to   be .    i   prefer   baz   luhrmann ['] s   version   though .
781899228	11468	4.5	['] layer   cake [']    has   fantastic   soundtrack !    daniel   craig   has   never   been   better ,    i   definitely   saw   the   future   bond   in   him .    all   the   characters   in   this   movie   were   well - played   by   the   actors .    plus ,    i   really   liked   the   ending .
781899228	758	4.5	this   movie   was   hilarious !    it   definitely   did   really   surprise   me .
781899228	1962	4.0	i   loved   the   story   of   this   movie .    it   reminded   me   a   lot   of    " groundhog   day "  .    i   really   loved   the   ending   too ,    it   was   different .    it   was   a   nice   little   movie .
781899228	5522	3.0	i   did   not   like   this   movie   that   much .    i   guessed   the   ending   within   15   minutes   of   watching   it    ( and   i ['] m   one   of   those   people   who   are   clueless    : p )  .    still   christian   bale   was   great   for   being   determined   and   losing   a   lot   of   weight   for   the   role .  .    and   then   later   buffing   up   for   batman   haha .    i   liked   the   eerie   atmosphere   in   the   movie   too .    i   guess   i   was   expecting   a   lot   more   from   this   movie .  .
781899228	5807	3.5	this   was   a   nice   mix   of   drama   within   a   comedy .    the   plot   of   this   movie   was   obviously   not   for   a   comedy ,    but   they   have   managed   to   get   around   that   and   make   it   light - hearted .    kate   hudson   is   an   angel .     :  )
781899228	10421	2.5	even   though   i   was   very   disappointed   that   the   wayans   brothers    ['] abandoned [']    this   movie .  .    i   still   had   high   hopes   for   this   movie   because   the   trailer   looked   funny   at   least .  .    well   i   was   wrong ,    the   trailer   was   pretty   much   all   the   funny   parts .    i   was   disappointed   in   this   movie .    it   wasn ['] t   as   good   as   the   first   two .    i   felt   awkward   sitting   in   the   theatres   watching   this .    there   was   way   to   much   slapstick   humor .    and   i   pretty   much   hate   slapstick   humor .    anthony   anderson   was   hilarious   in   this   movie   though
781899228	12546	4.0	home   alone   was   one   of   the   movies   that   i   would   always   watch   over   and   over   as   child .    it   is   now   very   nostalgic   to   me .    you   can ['] t   go   wrong   with   childhood .     :  )
781899228	16740	5.0	i   love   movies   that   have   multiple   stories   going   on   at   once ,    and   it   all   connects   together   in   the   end .    fantastic   characters   that   are   played   by    " top   tier "    actors .    well   played   music   and   tom   cruise ['] s   surprisingly   outstanding   performance   that   deserves   him   an   oscar .
781899228	10277	5.0	more   movies   need   to   be   like   this .    i   get   sick   of   the   cliche   hollywood   crap   sometimes .    i   can   not   praise   enough   of   the   neo   realism   that   this   film   has !    this   movie   made   laugh ,    cry ,    angry    ( at   the   thief   of   course )  .    i   really   felt   the   pain   of   the   characters .    it   had   a   great   message ,    and   it   is   one   of   my   favourite   movies .
781899228	2554	3.0	damn   was   this   movie   weird !    i ['] m   not   that   big   on   musicals   but   tim   curry   played   a   good   creepy   transvestite   and   susan   sarandon   was   smoking   hot   haha .
781899228	16879	4.5	i   remember   sitting   at   the   back   of   the   theatre   and   crying .    but   hey !    i   was   like   8   years   old   at   the   time !    one   of   the   best   romance   movies   yet .    i ['] m   glad   it   won   best   picture .
781899228	9940	4.0	this   movie   made   history .    it   is   a   classic   to   many .
781899228	7032	4.5	i   really   love   this   movie .    i   personally   think   this   was   better   than   the   previous   two   austin   powers   movie    ( which   would   be   pretty   hard   to   overcome )  .    when   i   saw   this   movie   in   the   theatres   i   was   almost   rolling   on   the   floor   laughing .    i   was   actually   in   tears .    joke   after   joke ,    it   was   a   fun   movie .
781899228	17703	2.0	probably   my   least   favourite   superhero   movie .    it   dragged   on ,    and   nothing   happened   until   like   the   last   ten   minutes   of   the   movie !
781899228	11152	5.0	damn   good   movie !    this   movie   had   such   complex   characters .    i   like   how   i   hated   edward   norton ['] s   character ,    but   then   i   started   to   sympathize   for   him ,    and   then   i   loved   his   character .    one   of   the   movie   powerful   movies   i   have   seen .    even   though   one   of   my   friends   spoiled   the   ending   for   me ,    i   still   enjoyed   it .

179832255	963	3.0	interesting   character   study   played   out   with   the   contrasting   personalities   of   blanche   and   stanley   who ,    along   with   stella   try   to   figure   out   who   they   really   are   and   what   they   should   be .       a   bit   melodramatic   most   of   the   time ,    and   very   much   so   at   others .       boring   in   the   middle ,    but   really   ramped   up   at   toward   the   end ,    you   see   leigh ['] s   best   acting ,    but   it   wasn ['] t   consistently   good .       brando   really   shines   for   most   of   the   film ,    too ,    and   malden   is   surprisingly   good   as   blanche ['] s   love   interest .       i   only   wish   the   tumultuous   climax   was   staged   differently ,    but   in   the    ['] 50s ,    you   could   only   do   so   much ,    and   it   was   censored   enough   as   it   was .       overall ,    a   must   see   for   all   film   buffs .
179832255	16242	3.5	i   liked   the   characters   if   not   so   much   the   actual   story .       malkovich   is   scary   as   hell .
179832255	6223	4.0	is   it   pat ['] s   best   movie ?    i   think   so .    better ['] n   ghost !
179832255	2430	4.0	way   cool !
179832255	15425	4.5	the   dude   is   all   that .       goodman   is   scary .       tell   me   what   sam   elliott   is   doing   in   this   movie ?
283321589	14691	4.0	excellent   action   film .    the   story   is   hard   to   follow   the   1st   time   you   watch   it ,    so   see   it   again !
283321589	3463	2.5	umm ,    i ['] m   not   sure   why   this   was   filmed ,    but   it   made   money !
283321589	11077	4.5	a   worthy   sequal !  !    very   rarely   find   that !  !
283321589	2782	5.0	beyond   words .    just   go   watch   it !
283321589	15205	3.0	a   good   film   that   somewhat   exaggerates   what   will   happen   if   mankind   doesn ['] t   stop   destroying   our   own   environment .    pending   we   are   actually   the   ones   doing   it .  .  .
283321589	15107	5.0	smart ,    intelligent ,    and   a   wild   ride .    just   wqhen   i   thought   i   had   this   one   figured   out ,    it   went   somewhere   else !
283321589	1905	4.5	an   excellent   pirateing   and   sailing   film   that   shows   just   what   life   at   sea   is   like !
283321589	8989	1.5	julia   stiles   reportedly   got   laid   during   filming !    it   didn ['] t   help   her   acting   though .
283321589	10928	4.0	hilarious !  !    not   a   lot   of   point ,    but   jim   carrey   was   in   a   role   almost   perfectly   suited   for   him !  !
283321589	7521	3.0	funny ,    albeit   dumb .
283321589	15063	0.5	this   was   equally   insulting   as   it   was   embarrasing   to   the   actors !
283321589	13610	4.0	i   really   liked   this   film ,    but   found   it   to   be   odd   as   to   how    " spidey "    can ['] t   get   hurt   either .
283321589	3962	4.0	a   good   story   about   life ,    put   to   a   story   line   about   a   young   fish   and   his   overprotective   father .
283321589	2463	4.5	hilarious !  !    i   loved   this   one !  !    it   was   choice !
283321589	17324	4.0	a   relatively   amusing   film   about   a   man   who    " hitches "    up   blind   dates .    not   bad   for   a   uot   of   character   role   for   will   smith .    he   could   do   better .    j - lo   was   misaerable .
283321589	6287	4.0	was   the   high   point   the   lotus   in   the   beginning   or   edward   james   olmos   harrassing   her   in   the   lobby ?
283321589	11337	3.5	good   film ,    it   actuals   makes   the    ['] teen   scene [']    realistic   and   humorous   too !
283321589	7032	3.5	funny !    almost   equal   to   the   1st ,    blew   the   2nd   out   of   the   water !  !
283321589	5239	1.5	instead   of   the   longest   yard ,    i   felt   it   was   more   like   the   longest   nap .    same   old   story ,    put   to   a   happier   cast    ( in   prison )  ?
283321589	758	3.5	a   out - of - left   field   story   line   that   made   this   somewhat   funny   and   good   to   watch .    before   lindsey   lohan   tried   to   become   the   next   super - ultra - mega   star
283321589	5991	4.5	i   loved   this   revenge   and   avenge   film !  !    a   group   of   short   stories   told   with   flair   and   pinache   that   takes   on   a   violent   flavor !  !
283321589	12471	3.5	a   good   movie ,    tellig   about   the   hardships   of   reality .    not   for   the   people   who   think   life   is   always   perfect   or   you   get   what   you   put   into   it .
283321589	3579	2.0	for   not   being   a   fan   of   the   1st ,    i   came   into   the   2nd   with   higher   hopes   and   was   dissapointed .
283321589	1962	3.0	interesting   storyline .    mediocre   acting .
751641127	17339	5.0	one   of   my   favorites .    it ['] s   really   funny   in   a   sick   twisted   kind   of   way .    not   really   anti - war ,    just   kind   of   people   surviving   during   war   which   in   liberal   hollywood   is   rare .
751641127	3463	3.0	this   is   not   as   horrible   as   some   of   the   other   asinine   teenager   movies   out   there ,    plus   me   and   a   girlfriend   fooled   around   watching   it .  .  .
751641127	8806	5.0	love   this   movie .    it ['] s   long ,    but   well   worth   it .
751641127	14755	1.0	i   saw   this   in   the   theaters   and   i   want   my   time   back   still .    over   hyped   and   not   very   good .    i   remember   back   in   the   day   when   it   came   out   and   how   amazing   it   was   and   blah ,    blah ,    blah .    it   wasn ['] t   that   good .    this   shows   why   you   should   never   believe   hollywood   hype   and   why   the   people   in   it   have   never   been   in   anything   again .
751641127	5696	3.0	this   is   not   a   bad   movie ,    but   i   was   really   expecting   mulder   and   scully   to   get   down   to   it   and   they   didn ['] t .    it   was   severely   over   hyped   at   the   time   too .
751641127	12071	3.5	this   movie   is   hilarious ,    but   it   isn ['] t   as   good   as   clerks .
751641127	8079	3.5	i ['] ve   seen   this   and   it   really   isn ['] t   as   stupid   as   i   thought   it   would   be .    i   was   pretty   pissed   off   when   kirsten   dunst ['] s   character   was   killed   off    ( oops   spoiler )    though .
751641127	6268	2.0	saw   it   in   theaters   and   it   wasn ['] t   really   bad ,    but   it   wasn ['] t   good   either .    it   kind   of   makes   you   achy .
751641127	15233	1.0	this   is   a   horrible   movie ,    but   every   time   they   play   it   on   comedy   central    ( weekly )    i   am   compelled   to   watch   it .    maybe   it ['] s   david   duchovny ?
751641127	2376	3.0	another   movie   thats   supposed   to   be   scary ,    but   is   funny   instead .    do   i   have   something   wrong   with   me   that   i   don ['] t   find   this   crap   scary ?
751641127	6989	4.0	i   remember   the   uproar   when   this   came   out   over   all   the   violence   and   crap .    those   people   are   in   fact   idiots   and   do   not   understand   satire   in   way   shape   or   form .    this   movie   is   so   over   the   top   in   its   depiction   of   violence   i   do   not   understand   how   anyone   can   seriously   believe   that   is   all   it   is   about .
751641127	12785	3.5	not   too   bad .
751641127	17479	4.5	this   is   the   scariest   movie   i   have   ever   seen .    screw   gore ,    when   it   fucks   with   your   head   its   worse .
751641127	17335	4.0	i   saw   this   a   long   time   ago   and   it   does   deserve   all   the   accolades   its   been   given .
751641127	13610	3.0	not   too   bad   a   movie .
751641127	7879	3.0	i   would   not   say   its   great ,    but   it   is   at   least   funny   which   most   attempts   at   comedy   movies   are   not .    it   is   also   extremely   quotable   which   is   a   good   thing   in   movies .
751641127	8993	2.0	kinda   disapointting   to   be   honest .    a   lot   of   the   episodes   are   funnier   and   its   not   really   unedited   and   uncut   at   least   in   version   i   have .    plus   they   played   it   on   tv   as   like   5   episodes   and   i   was   a   sucker   and   paid   for   it .
751641127	11337	3.5	as   stupid   as   it   looks   its   pretty   damn   funny .
751641127	5408	3.5	good   chance   to   see   the   original   gang   together   in   their   last   trek   movie ,    would   recommend   watching   it .
751641127	758	4.0	okay   i   feel   really   stupid   for   admitting   this ,    but   this   movie   is   actually   funny .    and   it   has   scores   of   babes   in   it .
751641127	331	1.0	i   really   do   not   like   this   movie   and   i   really   tried   to   since   kevin   smith   made   it .    you   go   into   it   thinking    " hey   a   lesbian   this   will   be   sexy   and / or   funny .  "    but   no   it   isn ['] t   and   there   is   no   where   near   enough   jay   and   silent   bob .
751641127	4995	0.5	this   movie   is   crap ,    britney   spears   can   barely   sing   let   alone   act .
751641127	12014	0.5	the   only   thing   worth   seeing   in   this   is   jennifer   love   hewitt ['] s   breasts   and   how   they   manage   to   defy   gravity .    other   than   that   its   a   terd .
751641127	7145	3.5	kind   of   a   forgotten   trek   movie ,    its   not   terrible   though .    spoiler   alert :    the   original   enterprise   gets   blown   up   which   is   pretty   damn   depressing   to   see .
751641127	788	5.0	i   just   saw   part   of   this   on   starz   and   its   still   funny   even   after   the   200th   time   i ['] ve   seen   it .    it ['] s   a   classic   for   sure .
751641127	2782	4.0	good   movie ,    hard   to   watch   since   mel ['] s   a   confirmed   anti - semite   though .
751641127	311	4.5	awesome   movie .
751641127	6908	2.0	go   figure   the   one   shatner   directed   would   be   the   worst   of   the   star   trek   movies .    the   story   line   is   this   movie   is   also   supposedly   not - canon   too   so   it   really   doesn ['] t   matter   if   you   see   it   then   or   not   does   it ?
751641127	15209	3.5	not   a   great   movie ,    but   its   good   entertainment   and   makes   me   wish   i   was   alive   in   the   70 ['] s   before   our   parents   ruined   casual   sex ,    booze ,    and   drugs   for   generation   x   and   y .    and   before   damn   opec   ruined   muscle   cars   for   us .
751641127	13302	5.0	this   is   one   of   the   funniest   movies   ever   and   it   is   a   true   classic .
751641127	2897	2.0	this   is   not   a   bad   movie ,    but   it   terrified   me   as   a   kid   and   it   still   does .
751641127	16879	0.5	only   one   good   scene   in   here .
751641127	6287	0.5	this   is   a   horrible   movie .    i   do   not   find   julia   roberts   pretty   which   shoots   the   whole   premise   in   the   foot .    plus   there   are   no   hookers   that   have   all   their   teeth   and   are   not   adicted   to   crack .
751641127	3920	0.5	the   only   thing
751641127	6337	3.0	this   is   pretty   funny   and   i   love   the   beat   up   superbird   he   drives .
751641127	5991	5.0	this   movie   is   the   shit   and   in   my   top - 10   at   present   time .
751641127	6971	3.0	good   movie   and   pretty   funny .    kind   of   overrated   in   my   mind   though   as   there   are   better   movies   out   there .
444022621	2985	1.5	havn ['] t   seen   it ,    but   i   have   seen   many   clips ,    in   my   honest   opinion ,    it   looks   like   a    " crap   teen   comedy "  !

240435883	7499	4.5	bill   pullman   looks   great   in   this   film ,    some   people   reckoned   he   was   unsuitable   for   the   role   of   president   but   i   don ['] t   care ,    i   think   he   did   really   well .    the   rest   of   the   cast   however   was   excellent   and   will   smith   deserves   a   round   of   applause   for   his   performance .    it ['] s   a   good   film ,    thrilling   and   action - packed .    the   aliens   made   me   laugh   but   oh   well ,    that ['] s   me .

240435883	7356	4.0	very   similar   to   armageddon .    the   same   kind   of   emotions   throughout   the   film ,    but   this   movie   is   slower - paced   and   focuses   more   on   the   people   on   earth ['] s   feelings   and   risk - taking .    elijah   wood   caught   my   eye ,    i   hadn ['] t   recognised   him   before   but   a   nice   performance   from   him .    keep   your   eyes   open ,    there ['] s   many   different   tales   entwined   in   this   movie ,    many   families   being   split   up   or   joined   together .    good   movie   overall ,    could   make   you   think   about   life   abit .

240435883	5401	4.0	it ['] s   such   a   funny   film ,    but   i   couldn ['] t   help   wanting   to   put   my   fist   in   ben   stiller ['] s   face .    i   much   prefer   to   watch   him   playing   the   sensitive   characters ,    like   in    ['] something   about   mary [']    for   example .    but   yeah ,    dodgeball   is   excellent .     =  )
240435883	2782	1.0	now   i   love   mel   gibson ,    but   watching   this   nearly   bored   me   to   tears .    only   for   people   with   long   attention   spans   and   a   liking   for   the   scottish   accent .
240435883	9442	5.0	this   guy   is   hot   in   this   film ,    for   his   acting   and   for   his   image .    he   suits   these   kind   of   roles   well ,    with   the   big   muscles   and   everything ,    but   it   would   be   good   to   see   what   else   he   will   try   in   the   future .
240435883	12299	5.0	excellent ,    the   cast   is   good   and   the   plot   i   surprisingly   enjoyed .    there   is   a   moment   in   the   movie   when   the   little   girl   is   pulled   out   of   the   water   when   she   jumps   off   a   boat ,    when   the   man   puts   his   coat   around   her ,    i   was   glued   to   my   seat   thinking   wow   this   guy   might   never   actually   hurt   her .    it   was   good   to   watch ,    wicked   film .    although   maybe   someone   like   me   could   easily   mistake   some   of   the   characters ,    looking   too   deeply   into   their   decisions ,    thinking   there   is   a   hidden   motive   or   hidden   feelings ,    i   have   a   habit   of   that .

512008896	17339	4.5	up   until   a   few   years   ago ,    there   were   some   genres   of   film   i   avoided .    as   i   started   to   open   up ,    i   wanted   to   select   something   that   represented   the   genre   well   but   would   also   be   broader   and   show   me   why   i   should   invest   time   in   these   genres .    full   metal   jacket   came   along   and   exceeded   my   expectations .    it ['] s   not   just   a   war   film ,    it ['] s   a   study   on   the   human   condition   under   adverse   circumstances .    it ['] s   films   like   this   and   unforgiven   that   make   me   feel   sorry   for   not   having   explored   their   respective   genres   earlier . unlike   many   other   war   films ,    this   is   not   focused   on   one   particular   battle   from   start   to   finish    ( the   very   reason   i   avoided   war   films   in   the   first   place )  ,    we   are   given   a   look   at   the   training   of   the   next   set   of   marines   to   be   shipped   off   to   fight   in   vietnam .    we   see   the   development   from   raw   recruits   to   soldiers .    this   is   also   rather   unique   because   we   can   see   the   cycle   of   a   soldier   from   recruit   to   veteran   through   one   man ,    private   leonard   lawrence ,    given   the   nickname    " gomer   pyle "     ( played   wonderfully   by   vincent   d ['] onofrio )  .    while   not   everyone   who   went   to   vietnam   had   it   bad   when   they   came   home   from   the   war ,    lawrence   is   the   best   example   of   the   demonstrating   the   mental   tortures   of   war .    the   surprising   fact   in   all   of   this   is   that   be   mentally   collapses   from   the   pressure   and   he   doesn ['] t   even   see   any   combat    ( i   should   warn   you   now   there   are   spoilers .    i   normally   don ['] t   consider   anything   that   happens   in   the   first   40   minutes   of   a   film   a   spoiler   but   since   it   involves   a   well   known   character   to   those   who   haven ['] t   seen   the   film ,    they   may   be   as   shocked   as   i   was )  . he   starts   off   as   a   recruit ,    one   who   is   struggling   to   cope   with   his   training ,    both   the   physical   and   psychological   aspects .    adding   to   this   is   the   fact   that   his   drill   instructor    ( played   by   r .    lee   ermey ,    who   mostly   improvised   his   lines   in   what   i   consider   one   of   the   finest   performances   in   the   history   of   film )    constantly   berates   him    ( he   is   also   the   one   who   bestowed   upon   him   the   nickname    " gomer   pyle "  ,    after   the   television   character )    and   his   fellow   recruits   resent   him ,    due   to   his   failures   holding   everyone   back .    eventually ,    he   improves   his   condition   but   his   mind   has   become   a   little   more   twisted   and   his   mental   state   has   come   into   question .    this   culminates   with   a   confrontation   with   the   drill   instructor ,    his   mind   completely   shattered .    he   ends   up   killing   the   instructor   and   then   himself .    intentional   or   not ,    this   could   be   considered   an   insightful   look   at   what   happens   to   someone   during   a   war .    they   start   out    " green "  ,    they   pick   up   skills ,    they   witness   atrocities   and   they   come   home   and   never   quite   re -

512008896	13073	4.5	often   i ['] ve   made   up   my   mind   long   before   seeing   a   movie   about   which   to   see .    it   can   take   a   lot   to   convince   me   otherwise   but   usually   my   mind   stays   set .    a   friend   recommended   this ,    saying   it   was   her   favorite   film   ever .    she ['] s   a   smart   woman   as   i   enjoyed   this   immensely .    i   think   most   of   the   reasoning   for   not   seeing   this   before   was   it   was   all   too   familiar   to   me   through   parodies   and   constant   cultural   references .    however ,    it   surprised   me   that   things   didn ['] t   quite   happen   as   i   thought .    i   had   assumed   george   bailey   and   clarence   would   meet   up   in   the   first   20   min   or   so   but   most   of   the   movie   focuses   on   george ['] s   life   and   the   events   leading   to   his   wanting   to   commit   suicide    ( since   the   movie   is   very   commonly   known ,    even   to   those   who   only   vaguely   know   it ,    i   don ['] t   think   i ['] m   spoiling   anything )  . george   bailey   could   very   well   be   the   most   put   upon   man   in   the   world .    all   of   his   plans   have   to   be   changed   to   accommodate   others   several   times ,    like   his   plans   to   further   his   education   or   to   go   on   his   honeymoon   but   he   always   takes   it   in   stride .    jimmy   stewart   does   a   wonderful   job   here ,    he   won   me   over   quite   a   bit   with   this   performance .    it ['] s   probably   a   good   thing   i   was   wrong   about   this   movie ,    i   was   expecting   a   darker   christmas   carol   where   george   would   be   taken   back   through   time ,    unable   to   interfere   and   we ['] d   see   the   events   unfold .    instead ,    we   get   to   know   george   before   his   meeting   with   clarence   so   it   gives   us   a   greater   empathy   for   him   and   his   situation . i   must   admit   while   i   thought   it   was   a   pretty   good   film   at   first ,    my   emotional   investment   didn ['] t   really   begin   until   george   is   yelling   at   his   family .    he ['] s   had   enough   to   deal   with   at   that   point   and   the   troubles   in   the   lives   of   his   kids   wasn ['] t   helping .    he ['] s   yelling   at   them   and   i ['] m   watching   and   feeling   it ['] s   a   bit   harsh .    this   is   really   where   things   started   getting   more   emotional   so   this   is   what   elevated   the   film . but   the   biggest   reason   i   added   this   film   to   my   top   100   is   the   ending   and   the   events   leading   to   it . the   emotional   content   here   is   quite   uplifting .    after   george   has   seen   the   difference   he   has   made   in   the   town   and   its   people ,    he ['] s   overjoyed   to   be   back .    he   runs   through   the   town   wishing   merry   christmas   to   the   people   and   buildings   and   such .    hell ,    he ['] s   about   to   be   arrested   for   misplaced   money   that   wasn ['] t   his   fault   but   he   doesn ['] t   care ,    he ['] s   just   glad   to   be   there .    then   the   scene   happens   that   caused   my   eyes   to   tear   up .    his   kids   are   upstairs   and   they   wish   him   merry   christmas   and   the   look   on   george ['] s   face   is   sheer   bliss .    he   runs   upstairs   to   hug   them   and   it ['] s   just   such   a   powerful   moment .    he   may   have   yelled   at   them   earlier   but   you   will   never ,    never   doubt   for   one   moment   that   he   loves   his   children .    no   matter   what   happens ,    even   if   a   sequel   had   been   made ,    nothing   could   destroy   the   power   of   this   scene . following   that ,    members   of   george ['] s   community   come   to   his   aid   to   donate   money   and   help   keep   his   business   open .    it ['] s   so   overwhelming ,    even   the   authorities   join   in   the   celebration   and   decide   to   drop   the   charges . and   it   is   here   that   the   movie ['] s   theme   really   shines   through :    one   man   really   can   make   a   difference .    and   that   true   value   comes   from   virtue   and   being   of   upstanding   nature .    as   one   of   the   last   lines   of   the   film   goes    " to   my   brother   george ,    the   richest   man   in   town "  .    money   means   nothing   when   you   have   the   faith   and   support   of   virtually   an   entire   town .    and   that ['] s   just   what   this   movie   is ,    a   triumph   of   the   human   spirit   over   the   desire   for   money   and   power . normally   i   don ['] t   go   in   for   this   light   fare   but   i   can   be   in   the   mood .    and   this ,    i   might   add ,    is   one   of   the   only   2   films   i ['] ve   ever   seen   that   has   made   me   cry    ( schindler ['] s   list   is   the   other )  .    and   they   both   have   something   in   common :    one   man   changing   things   for   the   better ,    albeit   obviously   under   very   different   circumstances .    maybe   it   just   reminds   me   even   i   can   make   a   difference ,    even   to   just   one   person .    whatever   it   may   be ,    this   is   considered   a   classic   for   a   reason   and   for   those   of   you   who

784182927	1719	3.5	this   was   a   very   weird   film .    i   liked   it   but   there   are   moments   where   you   go   from    " ahahah "    to    " wha ?  "     = pit   is   a   very   peculiar   movie   and   it ['] s   not   for   everyone .    you   have   to   watch   it   right   from   the   beginning   to   understand   all   of   it    =  )
784182927	6329	4.0	you   can   clearly   see   the   movie   is   old ,    it ['] s   funny   xd   but   i   loved   it   very   much .    the   story   is   awesome   and   the   acting   is   brilliant   too .    it ['] s   good   to   see   johnny   depp   in   his   strange   roles ,    it ['] s   when   he ['] s   at   its   best !  !
784182927	13524	3.5	i   really   like   this   movie .    it   was   realistic   and   jennifer   lopez   did   a   very   good   job .    it   was   one   of   the   few   movies   i   liked   with   her    =  )
784182927	13930	3.5	it ['] s   a   cute   film   with   some   very   funny   scenes    =  )    and   it   has   bernie   mac   in   it ,    so   it ['] s   always   good   xd
784182927	12838	4.5	so   good !  !    it   keeps   you   entertained   through   the   entire   movie   and   the   casting   was   chosen   very   well !    i   especially   liked   norman   reedus ,    he ['] s   cute    = panyway ,    i   recommend   it   strongly !
784182927	16452	5.0	wonderful   movie !    good   storyline ,    good   choice   of   actors ,    good   music .  .  .    it   is   one   of   those   movies   that   make   you   want   to   be   a   better   and   more   understanding   person    =  ) i   truly   recommend   this   to   everyone !
784182927	16879	5.0	i   absolutely   love   this   movie .    leonardo   dicaprio   and   kate   winslet   did   an   amazing   job   in   their   roles .    the   sinking   scene   was   heartbreaking   and   so   sad ,    especially   because   it   really   happened   in   real   life .    so   many   people   died   and   so   little   few   lived .  .  .    well ,    anyway ,    i   recommend   this   film   to   everyone    =  )
784182927	6687	3.0	the   special   effects   were   decent ,    although   you   could   clearly   see   in   some   scenes   that   they   were   computarized .    and   some   scenes   were   quite   unrealistic ,    like   the   one   where   thomas   jane   is   underwater   while   a   shark   is   approaching   him   and   he   jumps    ( even   though   he   has   no   support   to   do   it ,    so   it   would   be   quite   impossible )    on   top   of   the   shark !    anyway ,    it   still   manages   to   capture   your   attention ,    especially   in   the   scenes   with   the   cook    ( he ['] s   hilarious )  .    but   in   my   opinion ,     " jaws "    was   much   better .

788506271	7624	1.0	the   only   saving   grace   was   the   planes .    tom   cruise   is   sickeninly   overdramatic    ( and   this   is   before   he   turned   into   a   scientology   nut   job )  .    the   love   story   is   so   predictible .    i   could   definately   live   without   seeing   it   again .

788506271	1803	3.0	this   one   is   good .    the   hybrid   clone   thing   is   a   good   idea -    not   sure   if   i   would   have   cast   winona   ryder   though .
788506271	16879	1.0	the   ship   sinks ,    get   over   it !    i   gave   it   a   star   b / c   leonardo   dicaprio   bites   the   big   one   lol .
788506271	4656	3.5	i   loved   the   fight   in   this   movie .    however ,    i   felt   julia   roberts   was   a   little   off   in   the   lead   role .
788506271	6347	3.0	this   was   a   pretty   funny   movie .
788506271	6287	4.5	great   love   story .    not   typical ,    but   gere   and   roberts   are   great   together   in   this   one !

788506271	3860	1.5	ok   i   guess .    morgan   freeman   was   good   as   god .
788506271	14313	4.0	i   disagree .    the   patriot   was   a   well   thought   movie   about   one   family   doing   what   they   had   to   do   to   live   through   the   american   revolution .    good   alternative   to   casting   and   recasting   for   yet   another   george   washington   role .
788506271	12497	2.0	fairly   dumb    ( hey ,    it   is   about   cheerleaders )  ,    but   has   some   funny   parts .
788506271	7234	4.0	very   good .    robert   de   niro   and   cuba   gooding   jr .    are   both   excellent   in   this   one .
425060015	17482	4.5	love   the   tv   serial   so   i   really   wanted   to   see   it   when   i   heard   it ['] ll   be   made   into   a   movie .    just   a   typical   teenager   genre   but   because   i   am   a   fan ,    it ['] s   a   great   movie .    funny   and   classic .
425060015	6329	5.0	definitely ,    absolutely   one   of   the   best   movies   ever   made    ( or   should   i   say ,    is   the   best ?  !  )  .    this   character   of   edward   is   just   amazing .    in   reality ,    we   would   have   been   scared   by   someone   like   him ,    but   his   eyes   are   just   so   kind   and   nice   and   hopeless   that   we   can   do   nothing   but   try   to   help   him .    johnny   depp   and   tim   burton   are   the   most   genious   duo   ever   exist   in   the   universe   and   they   should   make   more   movies   together .    wynona   is   amazingly   beautiful   in   this   movie .    the   love   between   them   is   surreal   it ['] s   painful .    but   it ['] s   definitely   a   must   see   movie   before   you   die .    yes ,    it ['] s   that   good .    if   there   are   10   stars   for   the   rating ,    i ['] ll   give   it   20   stars   because   the   stars   just   will   never   be   enough   to   rate   this   legendary   masterpiece .
425060015	5496	4.0	watched   it   when   i   was   in   usa   too .    perfect   cast ,    thrilling   story ,    and   love   all   the   modern   environment   and   of   course ,    the   car !     :  )    sunny   is   love !

425060015	15058	4.0	romantic ,    stunning   and   enchanting   drama   movie .
425060015	10170	4.5	it ['] s   actually   better   than   the   first   one .    funny !
425060015	13610	5.0	watched   it   on   the   first   day   of   national   premiere   in   usa   in   2004 .    absolutely   better   than   the   first   one ,    and   it ['] s   just   amazing .    mary   jane ['] s   hair   color   is   so   beautiful !  !    xd   storyline   is   better   and   the   antagonist   is   much   much   scarier   than   the   green   goblin .
425060015	14574	4.5	who   haven ['] t   seen   this   movie ?    a   classic   romance   movie   about   a   man   and   a   woman   who   meet   through   the   internet .    i   always   like   this   kind   of   fantasy   love   story .     :  )    romantic ,    heartwarming   and   lovely .    that   sums   it   all .
425060015	3962	4.5	another   disney ['] s   classic .    cried   a   lot .    most   significant   thing   from   this   movie   is   the   dentist ['] s   nephew   named   darla   which   has   been   being   used   as   the   nickname   to   call   my   brother - in - law .    lol !  !  !    love   the   movie   but   love   the   characters   more .    remember   the   starfish ,    peach ?    that ['] s   the   most   hysterical   thing   i ['] ve   ever   seen .
425060015	2457	2.0	i   usually   love   this   type   of   movie ,    but   seriously   i   don ['] t   really   like   it .    not   a   fan   of   hilary   duff ,    and   chat   michael   murray ,    sorry   but   i   can ['] t   understand   why   people   consider   him   handsome   or   hot   or   whatever .    story - wise ,    it   just   doesn ['] t   make   sense .    the   chemistry   is   not   there ,    so   it ['] s   like   watching   2   people   being   forced   to   act   like   they ['] re   in   love   with   each   others ,    and   that ['] s   painful .
425060015	2463	3.5	i ['] ve   just   seen   it   in   dvd   and   dude ,    i ['] m   impressed .    the   characters   are   so   real   they   don ['] t   even   look   like   animation   for   me .    the   story   is   original ,    great   for   kids   and   parents    ( because   it   taught   lots   of   lesson   especially   an   importance   of   family )  .    very   great .
425060015	16948	4.5	a   must   see .
425060015	15532	5.0	love ,    love ,    love   the   movie .    the   themesong ,       the   whole   movie   atmosphere .  .    everything   about   it   just   reminds   me   of   the   regular   life   in   us .    first   movie   that   i   saw   in   us   during   my   trip   in   summer   1999 ,    and   it ['] ll   always   be   one   of   my   fave   movies !
425060015	7057	5.0	amazing   piece   of   hollywood ['] s   production .    ever .
425060015	11132	3.5	very   gory    ( damn   that   scene   where   somebody   got   killed   by   the   chainsaw !  )  ,    scary   and   intimidating   till   the   end .    definitely   not   for   faint - hearted .
425060015	2580	5.0	probably   my   fave   lindsay ['] s   movie   ever .    cried   a   lot   especially   during   the   ending   when   they   changed   back   to   their   own   bodies .    offering   lots   to   learn   from   this   movie .    and   most   of   all ,    it ['] s   fun   yet   not   tacky .    jamie   lee   curtis   is   a   big   actress   and   lindsay   is   lucky   to   be   able   to   get   in   a   movie   with   her .
425060015	6014	4.0	ok ,    first   time   i   heard   about   this   movie ,    i   wanted   to   see   it   because   of   paris .    i   saw   it   and   i   loved   it .    the   movie   is   crazy ,    scary ,    and   the   whole    ['] waxing [']    scenes   are   just   amazing .    i   can ['] t   take   some   of   them   because   i   can ['] t   stand   too - gory   stuffs    ( damn ,    i   actually   covered   my   eyes   for   about   80 %    of   the   movie   time ,    lol !  )    but   i   must   say   everything   is   well - prepared   and   it   became   one   of   best   horror / thriller   movies   i ['] ve   ever   seen .
425060015	17308	5.0	reese   witherspoon   is   the   best   choice   portraying   this   role   because   i   read   somewhere   she ['] s   a   smart   girl   in   the   real   life .    she   is   funny ,    natural   and .  .  .  .  .    blonde .    one   of   the   best   chick - flicks   ever ,    imo .    enough   said .
425060015	4109	3.0	quite   boring .    watched   it   just   because   of   christian   bale .     : p   he   portrayed   psychotic   person   quite   well ,    but   the   movie   lacks   atmosphere ,    imo .
425060015	6555	3.5	al   pacino   is   terrific .    great   thriller   with   enough   twists   and   brilliant   acting .    although   i   think   there   are   some   boring   parts   and   it ['] s   way   too   long .
425060015	14538	3.0	i   like   the   story   but   a   big   no - no   for   the   casts [']    chemistry .    i   don ['] t   know   why ,    just   don ['] t   suit   each   each   others   i   think .    overall ,    nice   rating   because   i   still   enjoy   watching   the   movie .
425060015	17295	3.5	i   can ['] t   remember   what ['] s   going   on   in   this   movie ,    but   still   remember   i   had   fun   watching   it ,    so .  .  .    yeah .    xdxd
425060015	13052	5.0	magnificent   movie   that   is   not   for   mainstream ,    i   think .    deep   meaningful   story ,    brilliant   acting   and   enchanting   relationship   between   the   family .    a   must   watch   if   you   care   about   quality   of   a   film .

425060015	6556	3.0	watched   it   just   because   it ['] s   romeo    &    juliet .    okay ,    and   also   because   of   leo .     : p   good   version   but   i   don ['] t   think   it ['] s   memorable .    enjoyed   it   but   not   a   movie   that   i ['] ll   remember   for   long .
425060015	13705	4.0	a   movie   that   brought   lots   of   controversy   around   that   time .    brilliant   performances ,    original   storyline   and   a   sexy   killer ,    all   in   a   movie .    who   can ['] t   resist ?
425060015	299	5.0	pioneer   of   chick - lits ,    how   can   i   not   like   it ?    renee   is   perfect   as   bridget ,    she ['] s   so   awkward   i   can ['] t   even   keep   my   eyes   off   her .    it ['] s   so   real .    not   a   hugh   grant ['] s   fan   but   he   did   a   good   job   here .    very   entertaining ,    funny ,    and   romantic   at   the   same   time .
425060015	1138	5.0	a   long - waited   movie   that   is   not   a   disappointment .    there   are   couple   of   funny   things   too   but   kudos   for   the   writers   for   the   scary   scenes .    brutally   done ,    psychologically   affective   because   i   watched   it   during   my   stay   in   usa   in   2003   and   i   couldn ['] t   sleep   after   that   because   i   was   afraid   there   would   be   a   serial   killer   around   the   town .    jesus ,    that   was   hysterical .
425060015	2095	4.0	typical   jim   carrey ['] s   movie .    not   his   fan   but   i   must   admit   i   usually   enjoy   his   movies    ( i   know   i   am   that   shallow ,    geez !  )  .    this   one   is   not   an   exception ,    i   like   it !
425060015	10828	5.0	classic   animation   piece   by   tim   burton ,    should   i   say   more ?    definitely   gothic ,    mind - twisted ,    weird ,    you   name   it .    if   you   love   burton ['] s   work ,    you ['] ll   love   it .
425060015	6816	4.5	very   cute   movie   with   a   touch   of   musical .    i   love   johnny   depp   here ,    he   might   be   a   naughty   kid   but   he   also   shows   good   side   of   his   personality   as   well .    too   bad   the   possibilities   is   lower   than   1 %    for   johnny   to   play   this   kind   of   character   again   in   the   future ,    i   think .     : p
425060015	16082	4.5	lovely !    i ['] ll   give   lower   rating   if   the   ending   were   different    ( e . g .    if   jen   came   back   to   her   youth )  .    it ['] s   magical   romance   movie   and   it ['] s   so   sweet .    must   see .
425060015	7828	5.0	awesome   dark   movie   with   lots   of   twists ,    another   memorable   one   for   me   too   since   it ['] s   one   of   the   movies   i   watched   in   us   too .    xd   sarah   michelle   gellar   played   brilliantly   here ,    so   did   reese   and   ryan .    i   love   this   movie   a   lot ,    it ['] s   just   so   america   i   don ['] t   know .    the   scene   in   the   end   was   shocking   yet   brilliant .    must   watch !
425060015	2372	2.5	can ['] t   really   understand   the   fuss   regarding   this   movie ,    but   maybe   it ['] s   just   not   my   kind ,    i   guess .    watched   it   during   my   holiday   in   us   too .  .    and   i   was   bored .    it   was   couple   of   mins   before   the   ending   that   things   got   a   little   bit   better .    but   i ['] ll   still   watch   the   next   sequel .
425060015	1975	5.0	one   of   the   most   creative ,    coolest   movies   i ['] ve   ever   seen .    definitely   must   see .
425060015	751	4.0	i   don ['] t   really   remember   it   but   there   are   some   gory   scenes   that   are   still   clearly   remembered   in   my   mind   even   till   now .    great   movie .
425060015	887	3.5	maybe   the   story   is   just   so - so ,    but   this   movie   didn ['] t   fail   to   entertain   me .
425060015	17129	4.5	awesome .
425060015	14999	5.0	charlize   theron   proved   to   the   world   that   she ['] s   not   just   a   beautiful   face .    i   became   her   fan   after   i   watched   this   amazing   movie ,    she   simply   deserved   that   oscar .    i   like   reading   about   crimes   or   things   like   that ,    and   when   i   read   about   aileen   wuornos ,    i   didn ['] t   pity   her   at   all .    when   i   watched   the   movie ,    i   actually   felt   pity   to   the   character   and   felt   that   she   should   have   not   been   executed .    overall ,    a   great   movie   you   don ['] t   want   to   miss .

425060015	3333	2.5	watched   it   when   i   was   in   usa ,    2004 .    we   watched   the   first   day   of   the   national   premiere .    i   couldn ['] t   understand   the   story       ( well ,    partly )  ,    because .  .  .    i   just   couldn ['] t .    there   are   some   scenes   that   shocked   me   but   overall   i   think   it ['] s   kinda   boring   and   i   believe   some   of   the   audiences   who   watched   it   with   us   that   time   also   think   that   way   because   some   of   them   just   left   the   cinema   in   the   middle   of   the   movie .    it ['] s   far   worse   than   my   expectation   because   i   always   wait   for   m .    night   shyamalan ['] s   work   but   this   time   i ['] m   hardly   impressed .
425060015	16465	5.0	one   of   my   fave   movies   all   the   time .
425060015	5071	4.0	i   usually   like   drew   barrymore ['] s   movies   and   this   one   is   not   an   exception .    beautiful   and   interesting   story ,    good   laughs ,    and   lovely   casts .
425060015	11337	4.0	one   of   my   all - time   fave .    so   funny   and   entertaining .    watched   it   when   i   was   in   usa   so   it   brings   back   lots   of   memories .    love   the   casts ,    the   storyline ,    the   ending .    go   jason    &    alyson .     : d
425060015	758	4.0	not   a   fan   of   lindsay   but   i   used   to   like   her   during   mean   girls   period .    she   proves   that   she   can   act   naturally   and   the   storyline   is   funny .    more   amused   by   the   3   mean   girls .     :  )    an   easy   movie   for   relaxing   or   holiday .    nice .
425060015	3079	5.0	one   of   my   fave   disney ['] s   animation .    first   of   all ,    the   characters [']    images   are   so   cute !    the   tiny   simba   is   sooooo   cute ,    the   time   when   he   was   just   born   and   being   announced   as   the   to - be - king   by   rafiki .     * pinch *    and   mufassa ,    who   will   not   cry   when   he   died ?  ?    i   cried   like   crazy   during   that   scene .    but   the   whole   movie   is   just   amazing .
425060015	3890	2.5	not   lindsay ['] s   fan   but   i   usually   like   lindsay ['] s   movies ,    but   this   one .  .    it ['] s   a   bit   confusing   and   weird .    i   like   how   they   added   stories   inside   stories ,    though .    but   still ,    it ['] s   probably   my   least   fave   lindsay ['] s   movies .
425060015	16113	4.5	funnier   than   the   first   one   but   love   both !
425060015	6365	4.0	well - done   epic   movie   that   actually   changed   my   perception   towards   orlando   bloom .    great   movie .
425060015	14050	4.5	gene   wilder   as   the   original   willy   wonka   is   the   best   choice   one   can   ever   imagine .    don ['] t   really   like   the   charlie ['] s   image   here   but   i   guess   it ['] s   all   sadder ,    poorer   and   more   bitter   charlie   than   portrayed   in   the   original   book .    the   oompa - loompas   are   so   scary - looking ,    to   be   honest .    but   overall ,    the   movie ['] s   quite   good   considering   the   time   when   the   movie   was   made   and   the   limited   image   effects   available   during   that   time .    it ['] s   definitely   a   classic .
425060015	9800	4.5	very   funny .    a   good   story   which   can   be   taken   as   a   lesson   in   life .    great   effort ,    but   still ,    i   hope   they ['] ve   shown   more   gwyneth   in   fat   suit !  !    xd
425060015	985	4.5	neat   graphic   effects ,    good   thriller ,    and   historical   tidbits   make   it   even   more   awesome .
425060015	12232	2.5	i   expected   a   lot   from   this   movie .    somehow   i   don ['] t   really   appreciate   the   way   they   portray   japan ,    though .    it ['] s   kinda   bland   and   boring   sometimes .
425060015	12238	3.5	intriguing ,    romantic ,    painful    ( watching   him   giving   up   sex   for   such   a   long   time )    yet   sweet   in   the   same   time .    funny   if   you   see   from   the   other   side   too .
425060015	3864	4.5	always   a   fan   of   superheroes   movies   so   i   absolutely   watched   it .    the   movie   is   very   well   made ,    good   storyline ,    great   casts    ( even   ken   watanabe   is   in   it !  )  ,    and   everything   just   runs   smoothly   for   this   movie .    cillian   murphy   is   brilliant   as   the   villain   but   really ,    really   take   my   hat   for   christian   bale   for   the   good   impersonation   of   batman    ( and   also   for   pumping   up   that   body   from   the   last   time   i   saw   him   in   the   machinist !  !  )  .
425060015	16242	4.5	became   a   nicolas   cage ['] s   fan   since   i   watched   this   movie .    an   action   genre   but   fulfilled   with   emotional ,    touching   scenes   and   sweet   soundtrack .    i   consider   it   a   semi - classic .
425060015	14737	4.0	funny .    gorgeous   stars .
425060015	4310	4.0	brutally - exposed ,    great   humor   and   artistically   done .
425060015	3860	3.5	not   a   fan   of   jim   carrey ,    but   i   must   admit   his   movies   are   always   entertaining   for   me .    the   storyline   is   different   from   his   usual   movies   but   it ['] s   heartwarming .     :  )    morgan   freeman   rocks .    i   watched   it   just   recently   because   i   wanted   to   see   cameo   appearance   of   janelle   pierzina    ( big   brother   rules ,    man !  )    but   ended   up   not   seeing   her .     :  (    i   still   think   jim   carrey   overacts   most   all   the   time   and   that ['] s   irritating   to   see   how   he   makes   all   the   faces ,    it ['] s   boring .    this   is   another   tear   jerker   so   prepare   your   kleenex !
425060015	17697	4.0	the   twins   impressed   me   so   much   in   this   movie .    i   am   not   sure   whether   it ['] s   just   easy   to   play   their   roles   or   what ,    but   i   must   admit   they   can   act .    and   the   fact   that   they   actually   look   cute   there   could   actually   make   me   liking   them   a   little   bit   more .     :  )    i   hope   they ['] ll   be   in   another   movie   someday .

787520443	3463	3.5	really   funny   and   unexpected   for   a   comedy   movie ,    specialy   one   that   wasn ['] t   recognized   much
787520443	2985	3.0	like   i   said ,    not   the   best   but   time   well   wasted
787520443	15107	4.5	very   well   put   together ,    the   type   of   movies   that   totally   amaze   you   in   the   end   when   you   figure   out   how   stupid   you   were   for   thinking   you   knew   what   was   going   on
787520443	3938	5.0	the   best   of   the   3   shreks ,    it   was   great
787520443	14103	5.0	probably   one   of   my   favorite   loves   stories    (    i   don ['] t   most   chick   flicks )    but   yeah   very   emtional ,    good   movie
787520443	7521	2.5	once   again ,    not   my   type   of   comedy   i   guess
787520443	15063	3.0	actually   funnier   than   expected   for   two   guys   acting   like   girls ,    good   times

787520443	17479	3.0	not   the   scariest   i ['] ve   seen   by   a   long   shot .
787520443	13610	4.0	best   marvel   made   movie   out   there   i   think   for   the   moment
787520443	10583	3.5	if   it   wasn ['] t   for   jack   black   this   ovie   would   really   suck ,    so   it ['] s   ok .
787520443	3962	5.0	all   pixar   movies   will   be   better   than   averadge   in   my   book ,    i   recommend   everyone   sees   them   all
787520443	2457	3.5	i   must   say   i   liked   this   remake   of   cinderella ,    some   really   good   music   and   it   was   good   to   see   chad   michael   doing   a   role   that   wasn ['] t   luke
787520443	17324	4.0	will   is   one   of   my   fav   actors ,    eva   mendez   is   hot   so   yeah   it   was   a   good   movie ,    but   i   think   smith   did   better   in   i - robot
787520443	2463	5.0	one   of   the   pixars .  .  .    so   you   know   what   i   think
787520443	7664	5.0	once   again ,    great   story   line ,    but   the   fight   scenes   made   it   perfect
787520443	11337	5.0	s . w - s   came   out   as   stiffler ,    and   we   all   remeber   him   as   nothing   less

787520443	12471	5.0	its   not   just   because   eminem   is   the   best ,    but   i   realyl   think   he   did   good   for   his   first   movie    .  .  .    and   maannn   freestyling   was   super   good ,    great   ending   in   my   opinion
787520443	11077	3.5	ben   does   better   in   this   than   something   about   mary
787520443	15205	3.5	really   good   since   something   like   this   could   be   possbile   if   we   keep   kiling   the   planet !  !    really   nice   affects

347034612	7521	2.0	it   is   what   it   is
347034612	4262	4.0	stellar   cast ,    with   burton   at   his   burtonesque   best    ( i   refuse   to   say   gothic ,    its   too   distinctive   for   that )    a   neat   little   thriller   that   rattles   along   at   perfect   pace   with   depp   putting   in   a   performance   of   troughton   proportions !

148930660	6400	4.0	at   the   very   least ,    it ['] s   worth   watching   just   to   see   fraud   in   action .

148930660	11022	1.0	i   have   to   say   some   parts   of   it   were   funny ,    however ,    it   is   also   completed   one - sided   and   manipulated .       if   you   know   absolutely   nothing   about   politics ,    you   can   watch   this   and   pretend   you   do .       but   if   you   actually   exercise   your   right   to   vote   and   have   a   brain ,    then   this    " documentary "    is   just   going   to   piss   you   off .

148930660	30	3.0	this   movie   loses   points   for   old   people   having   sex .

786678339	10928	4.0	i   know   i   will   be   slated   for   this ,    but   jim   carrey   is   one   of   the   funniest   men      alive !  !
786678339	15063	3.0	this   was   surprisingly   good .    maybe   because   i   wasnt   expecting   too   much .

786678339	5239	3.0	i   am   huge   fan   of   adam   sandler ,    but   this   is   one   of   his   worst    .

786678339	1962	4.0	great   acting   and   humour   and   story   line ,    a   little   naughty   but   brilliant   overall .
795867383	13273	4.0	i   didn ['] t   think   i   would   like   this   movie .       all   the   feedback   i   got   were   quite   negative .  .  .    but   to   try   out   my   new   tv   i   bought   the   blu - ray   version   of   it   and   i   was   impressed !       not   just   by   the   actions   and   all   the   pretty   people   in   it ,    but   i   actually   thought   the   story   was   intriguing !       i   like   this   movie !
795867383	7294	3.0	i   really   liked   the   soundtrack .
795867383	17482	4.0	i   used   to   love   alicia   silverstone !       but   this   movie   itself   was   a   great   one   not   only   because   alicia   silverstone   starred   in   it .       a   movie   about   the   chicks   but   interesting   enough   for   guys   to   watch   too .       i   really   liked   it .
795867383	6329	3.5	it ['] s   a   simple   tale ,    but   point   taken .
795867383	14590	3.0	i ['] ve   only   watched   this   movie   once ,    and   i   remember   i   did   not   like   it   too   much .  .  .    i   mean ,    it ['] s   a   good   action   movie ,    but   i   didn ['] t   love   it   like   how   i   loved   the   first   two .
795867383	16384	4.0	i   loved   the   cat    &    mouse   game   between   harrison   ford ['] s   character   and   tommy   lee   jones ['] s   character !
795867383	4883	3.0	not   exciting   enough .
795867383	15421	3.5	i   loved   the   cast ,    loved   the   story ,    loved   the   film .       my   girlfriend   is   a   huge   fan   of   the   newly   adapted    " pride   and   prejudice "    film   so   comparisons   are   unavoidable .       i   think    " p & p "    is   a   prettier   film ,    but    " s & s "    has   a   more   complex   yet   down - to - earth   plot   and   makes   one   truly   content   and   happy   after   viewing   it .       it   is   definitely   just   as   good ,    if   not   better ,    than   the    " p & p "  .
795867383	13359	2.5	loved   the   cast ,    but   had   absolute   no   interest   in   the   story   or   the   music .
795867383	406	3.0	great   builtup ,    but   i   thought   ended   a   little   bit   weak .
795867383	4141	3.5	entertaining .
795867383	16784	4.0	we   wanted   to   watch   it   because   the   trailer   for   the   upcoming   sequel   seemed   interesting .  .  .    and   as   it   turned   out   this   movie   was   way   better   than   what   we   had   expected .       really   liked   it .
795867383	3148	2.0	i   was   glad   when   the   movie   finally   ended .       the   most   important   component   of   a   movie   is   its   plot ,    and   unfortunately   i   had   a   problem   with   the   plot   in    " the   english   patient "  .  .  .    mainly   that   the   love   affair   did   not   resonate   with   me   one   bit .       it   is   hard   to   like   a   movie   when   its   characters   have   very   different   values   from   yours .       i   guess   i   am   not   trying   hard   enough   to   put   myself   in   their   shoes   under   those   circumstances .  .  .    but   a   good   movie   shouldn ['] t   need   the   audience   to   try   too   hard .       just   the   plot   alone   i   would ['] ve   given   only   a   star ,    but   it   is   a   quality   production   and   all .  .  .    plus   i   love   juliette   binoche .
795867383	13610	5.0	the   movie   has   great   plot   and   action   scenes .  .  .    it   is   one   of   my   favorite   superhero   movies   so   far !  !
795867383	14574	3.5	i   watched   it   when   it   was   release   in   theater .  .  .    felt   nothing ,    did   not   like   it .       i   watched   it   again   just   recently   on   dvd   because   i   was   bored ,    and   for   some   reason   i   was   able   to   feel   their   emotions   much   better   and   liked   it   a   lot   more .       light - hearted   romantic   flick .
795867383	12881	4.0	loved   the   music   and   loved   nicole   kidman !
795867383	3962	3.5	i   liked   the   bond   between   the   father   and   the   child   and   the   animation   was   beautifully   done .
795867383	2463	4.5	superheros   with   ordinary   people ['] s   problems .  .  .    very   funny   and   interesting .
795867383	17324	2.0	this   movie   had   the   potential   to   be   good .  .  .    and   it   was ,    up   until   the   end .       ending   sucked ,    and   for   me   a   movie   can ['] t   possibly   be   good   if   it   fails   to   end   at   least   on   par   with   the   rest   of   it .       too   bad .
795867383	4996	2.5	angelina   jolie   was   not   attractive   at   all   in   this   movie .  .  .    i   guess   it   also   takes   some   talent   to   be   able   to   accomplish   that ,    whoever   her   dresser   was .
795867383	2992	4.0	i   think   the   rock   kicked   ass   in   this   movie .       this   is   a   great   action - comedy   film .       i   love   christopher   walken !     & gt ;  : d
795867383	1105	0.5	i   wish   they   could   go   back   in   time   and   undo   this   movie .       its   existence   ruins   the   robocop   legacy !
795867383	15532	4.0	i   know   it ['] s   kinda   cheesy   and   possibly   corny   and   it ['] s   like   the   mother   of   all   chick   flicks .  .  .    but   i   enjoyed   it   and   i   think   i   almost   loved   it .  .  .    rachael   leigh   cook   was   so   hot !
795867383	5472	3.5	i   was   exhausted   from   laughing .  .  .
795867383	9913	4.0	nice   addition   to   the   matrix   storyline .
795867383	2874	1.0	i   love   will   ferrell ,    but   this   movie   stinks !
795867383	2580	4.0	this   is   the   first   lindsay   lohan   movie   i ['] ve   watched ,    and   i   thought   she   was   adorable ,    and   the   story   is   pretty   good .
795867383	11323	2.5	not   as   good   as   the   first   one .  .  .
795867383	6400	4.0	steven   spielberg   is   at   it   again !       great   film .
795867383	10358	2.5	they   put   one   too   many   bad   jokes   in   this   film .  .  .    corny   and .  .  .    maybe   stupid .       seriously ,    one   joke ,    that ['] s   all   it   took ,    and   the   movie   was   dead .
795867383	16825	4.0	i   love   mel   gibson   and   jodie   foster .  .  .    not   to   mention   jodie   foster ['] s   smoking   hot   in   this   movie !
795867383	17506	4.0	not   your   typical    " lived   happily   ever   after "    romantic   movie ,    but   a   good   one   nonetheless .
795867383	3425	3.5	a   little   too   long   for   me .
795867383	11696	4.0	i   laughed   so   hard .
795867383	6692	1.5	catherine   zeta - jones   is   very   hot ,    but   the   movie   fell   way   short .       forgettable   plots   and   dialogs ,    this   movie   is   no   good .
795867383	7635	3.0	one   of   the   better   comedies   from   will   ferrell .       he   is   funny ,    but   some   of   his   movies   were   just   too   silly   or   stupid .       i   think    " anchorman "    got   it   just   right .  .  .    not   too   stupid ,    but   funny   enough .       i   love   steve   carell   in   this   movie !
795867383	15764	1.0	just   terrible .
795867383	13582	4.0	great   romantic   flick .       one   of   drew   barrymore ['] s   best   movies .
795867383	6972	3.5	definitely   better   than    " deep   impact "
795867383	13705	3.5	interesting   storyline ,    strong   casts ,    and   not   to   mention   the   love   scenes .       it   was   a   good   movie   from   start   to   finish .
795867383	6545	5.0	the   ending   for   china ['] s   theatrical   release   sucked !       that   was   the   version   i   first   saw ,    and   i   remember   feeling   really   bad   and   thinking    " here   we   go   again   a   good   movie   with   sloppy   ending .  .  .    typical   hk   movies .  .  .  "    but   when   i   bought   the   dvd   and   watched   it   again   with   my   friends ,    i   was   very   surprised   to   see   a   different   ending .  .  .    the   real   ending .  .  .    and   i   was   very   happy .  .  .    it   was   good .  .  .    yeh ~
795867383	299	4.0	by   the   end   of   the   movie ,    we   were   already   way   too   attached   to   bridget   to   not   see   her   get   her   happy   ending   would   have   definitely   crushed   us .       i   loved   it .       my   wife   fell   asleep   because   she   saw   it   already ,    but   i   stayed   up   and   finished   it   by   myself .       bridget   is   such   an   interesting   character .       i   felt   like   i   knew   someone   just   like   her   in   real   life .       i   guess   that ['] s   why   the   movie   scored   big   with   most   of   its   audience .
795867383	2095	4.0	this   movie   found   the   perfect   outlet   for   jim   carrey ['] s   outrageous   style   of   performance .       i   loved   it !
795867383	16441	2.0	not   as   good   as   the   first   one .
795867383	7227	3.5	originally   i   gave   it   a   2 - star ,    but   i   just   saw   it   again   this   evening   and   i   really   don ['] t   understand   why   didn ['] t   i   like   it   before .       i   think   this   is   a   very   entertaining   movie ,    and   i   liked   it   very   much .        " sparky "    is   hot .
795867383	15110	2.0	not   as   good   as   the   first .
795867383	886	3.5	the   music   is   great .
795867383	2800	2.0	i ['] m   sorry   but   to   me   love   is   also   about   commitment ,    and   with   commitment   comes   responsibility .       the   two   main   characters   lacked   both ,    and   although   one   might   think   this   was   a   romantic   story   of   love ,    i   can   only   see   it   as   two   extremely   selfish   people   got   together   at   the   end .
795867383	15853	4.0	disgusting   and   oh   so   good .  .  .    very   exciting   movie   and   keeps   you   on   the   edge   of   your   toes .  .  .    one   of   the   better   video   game   based   movies .
795867383	4472	5.0	one   of   my   favorite   romantic   movies   so   far .
795867383	2391	3.0	the   end   was   a   little   too   convenient .  .  .    but   overall   an   enjoyable   movie .
795867383	3750	4.0	great   movie ,    but   i   kinda   wish   some   of   the   elements   of   the   story   could   have   been   developed   more .

795867383	13651	4.0	if   harrison   ford   ran   for   president   when   this   movie   was   released ,    i   think   he   could   have   won .

795867383	6350	4.0	most   of   jackie   chan ['] s   movies   have   lame   plots .  .  .    but   rush   hour   isn ['] t   one   of   them .

202829854	6329	2.0	i   haven ['] t   watched   this   movie   in   a   while   but   i   really   hate   tim   burton .    the   guy   is   a   total   nutcase .    i ['] m   hate   his    " i ['] m   an   artiste "    persona .    anyway ,    the   movie   is   now   considered   a   classic   because   of   the   dark   and   depressing   cinematography   which   has   now   famed   burton .    depp   and   ryder   are ,    together ,    above   par ,    but   not   phenominal ,    on   screen .    it   reminds   me   of   a   disney   movie   on   shrooms    -    come   to   think   of   it ,    that   might   be   more   interesting   to   watch .
202829854	3524	4.5	this   all   star   cast   executes   flawlessly   in   tarantino ['] s   best   movie   to   date .    there ,    i   said   it ,    his   best   movie .    yes ,    reservoir   dogs   is   a   fucking   awesome   movie   but   this   is   just   that   much   better .    the   subplots   really   add   to   the   movie   and   watching   them   tie   in   together   at   the   end   has   a   great   effect   overall .    samuel   l   jackson   citing   lines   from   the   bible   is   priceless .    all   that   said ,    i   think   bruce   willis   steals   the   show .    even   though   his   role   isn ['] t   all   that   involved   his   character   couldn ['] t   have   been   acted   by   anyone   else ,    it ['] s   almost   as   if   the   part   was   written   for   him .    the   only   reason   it   doesn ['] t   get   5   stars   is   because   we   never   find   out   what ['] s   in   that   goddamn   brief   case .  . well   that ['] s   not   the   reason   but   i   can ['] t   think   of   a   better   one   right   now .
202829854	14691	4.0	i   can ['] t   imagine   anyone   hasn ['] t   seen   this   movie   by   now .    very   interesting   premise   with   alright   acting .    keanu   reeves   is   really   suited   for   this   role   but   he   still   can ['] t   fucking   act .    larry   fishburne   is   a   nice   standout   and   makes   the   movie   for   me .    way   too   many   sequels ,    the   ending   of   this   movie   was   a   perfect   way   to   end   it .    oh   well ,    that ['] s   the   way   the   cash   rolls .
202829854	143	3.5	great   movie .    awesome   plot   twist   at   the   end   of   the   movie    -    you   really   won ['] t   see   it   coming .    the   acting   is   bang   on   and   wish   that   sean   penn   had   a   bigger   role   in   the   movie   but   it   all   really   ties   well   together .    if   you   like   mystery / thriller   movies   you   will   love   this   movie .
202829854	5762	3.5	the   best    " real "    music   movie   i ['] ve   ever   seen .    kate   hudson   is   captivating   as   penny   lane   and   you   can ['] t   help   but   fall   in   love   with   the   fictional   band   stillwater .    jason   lee ,    although   not   the   lead ,    along   with   the   rest   of   the   band ,    points   the   movie   in   the   right   direction .    the   standout   is   definitely   crudup   as   an   aspiring   journalist   who   ends   up   with   a   contract   for   rolling   stone .    the   movie   is   funny ,    romantic ,    dramatic   and   all   around   frustrating .    you   never   really   know   you   should   root   for   but   the   movie   leaves   you   with   a   grea   feel .    crowe   is   impecable   at   telling   his   story .
202829854	15107	3.5	another   movie   that   turned   out   to   be   better   than   i   thought   it   was   going   to   be .    brad   pitt   and   george   clooney   don ['] t   have   great   chemistry   on   film   but   they ['] re   both   good   enough   to   play   well   apart .    matt   damon   is   a   bit   undercast   in   this   role .    this   movie   would   get   a   better   review   if   it   was   an   original   movie   and   not   a   remake .    still   i   recommend   watching   it .
202829854	1905	2.5	johnny   depp   does   do   a   pretty   good   job   on   this   film .    that   said ,    he ['] s   always   fucking   good .    i   can ['] t   think   of   a   movie   that   he   sucked   in .    but   that ['] s   were   the   good   ends .    this   movie   pretty   much   blows .    there ['] s   really   nothing   to   watch   for .    for   christ ['] s   sake    -    it   was   based   on   a   roller   coaster   ride .    how   good   could   it   be ?    watch   it   for   yourself   and   decide .
202829854	10451	3.0	this   movie ['] s   fucked   up .    stanley   kubrick   is   fucked   up .    definitely   should   been   seen   by   everyone   but   expect   to   see   the   most   shocking   movie   you ['] ll   ever   see .    if   the   movie   wasn ['] t   so   dark   it   would   have   been   a   lot   better   in   my   opinion .    the   storyline   is   pretty   unique   and   well   executed .    it   really   makes   you   think   about   the   way   things   were   done   in   the   past   and   why   they ['] ve   changed   for   today ['] s   standards .
202829854	673	4.0	when   i   saw   the   previews   for   this   movie   i   thought   it   looked   like   the   dumbest   piece   of   shit   ever   deemed   a   hit .    from   the   general   public   who   attended   this   movie ,    i   had   the   same   feeling .    after   the   movie   is   all   said   and   done   it   leaves   a   really   cool   feel .    the   movie   is   dark   yet   can   be   quite   funny   at   times .    pitt   and   norton   are   excellent   together .    aside   from   all   of   the   obvious   violence   you ['] re   going   to   get   out   of   this   movie ,    expect   it   to   prevoke   some   thoughts   along   the   way .    great   flick .
202829854	17479	4.0	scariest   fucking   movie   in   a   long   time .    i   now   own   this   movie   and   still   don ['] t   really   like   to   watch   it   late   at   night .    i   really   like   noami   watts   even   though   her   acting   can   sometimes   feel   really   empty .    too   bad   they   made   a   sequel   to   this .  .  . then   again   it   was   based   on   a   japanese   movie   which   was   apparently   much   better .    i   can ['] t   stand   subtitles .
202829854	10583	1.5	what   a   lackluster   movie .    jack   black   is   really   wasted   in   this   movie .    the   fact   that   black   would   even   be   considered   for   a   pg   movie   is   ridiculous .    the   only   good   thing   about   this   movie   is   the   hommage   to   70s   and   80s   metal .    big   waste   of   time .
202829854	2463	3.0	great   animated   flick ,    one   of   the   better   ones   to   date .    that   is   to   say    -    visually   stunning .    as   far   as   premise ,    it   definitely   lacked .    there   was   no   real   baring   or   what   you ['] d   expect   from   a   cartoon    -    some   kind   of   moral .    once   again ,    it   was   better   than   average   so   i ['] d   still   recommend   it   but   if   you   want   to   watch   an   animated   movie ,    i ['] d   recommend   shrek   if   you   haven ['] t   seen   it   instead .
202829854	13614	4.0	unbelievably   hilarious   movie   from   the   creator   of   beavis   and   butthead    ( never   thought   i ['] d   put   that   into   a   sentence )  .    everyone   in   the   movie   does   a   great   job   but   bader   really   stands   out   in   his   role .    the   movie   is   based   on   a   comic   strip   called   milton (  ?  )    although   milton   himself   doesn ['] t   play   a   huge   role   but   adds   quite   a   bit   of   comic   relief .    if   you   can   somewhat   associate   with   office - related   work ,    you ['] ll   love   this   movie .    the   highlight   of   the   movie   to   me   is   the   copy   machine   incident   with   geto   boys   playing   in   the   background .
202829854	14780	1.5	what   a   disappointing   movie .    great   cast ,    terrible   execution .    this   movie   is   right   up   there   with   drop   dead   fred .    this   movie   is   good   for   anyone   under   then   age   of   11 .    don ['] t   even   bother .
202829854	11337	3.0	this   would   be   the   biggest    " teen   movie "    for   my   generation .    it   seems   to   get   worse   everytime   i   watch   it .    the   acting   is   actually   alright   but   the   script   isn ['] t   very   impressive .    you   kind   of   alway   hope   that   things   are   going   to   work   out   for   their   crew   but   it ['] s   high   school   and   you   know   that   it   won ['] t .    the   worst   thing   about   this   movie   is   that   it ['] s   all   based   on   sex .    it ['] s   not   like   when   you ['] re   in   high   school   there ['] s   nothing   but   sex .    yes ,    it ['] s   a   hot   topic   but   to   base   a   whole   teen   movie   around   it   is   kind   of   monotonous .    this   is   definitely   no   hughes   movie   but   it   describes   a   generation   and   has   a   pretty   cool   mid - 90s   soundtrack .
202829854	14042	3.0	haven ['] t   seen   this   in   a   while   and   i ['] ll   definitely   have   to   watch   it   again   to   fully   appreciate   it .    it ['] s   right   up   there   with   lost   highway ,    not   sure   what ['] s   really   going   on .    there ['] s   some   really   interesting   lesbian   moments   which   are   pretty   much   uncalled   for   but   still   fun   to   watch .    anyway ,    i ['] d   watch   lost   highway   first   but   you   should   probably   watch   this   too .
202829854	8016	2.0	very   disappointing   movie   from   a   fantastic   director .    the   movie   seems   like   a   big   excuse   to   watch   cruise   and   kidman   get   it   on .    sure ,    there ['] s   a   whole   psychological   side   to   it   but   it   gets   old   fast .    raunchy   and   inappropriate .
202829854	4996	2.5	what   a   stupid   movie   and   waste   of   talent .    having   to   steal   cars   for   someone   so   he   doesn ['] t   kill   your   brother   and   then   not    " winning "    because   one   of   the   cars   is   a   bit   banged   up .    good   lord .  .  . anyway ,    the   movie   showcases   some   rare   and   sexy   cars   which   is   why   it   gets   any   stars   at   all .    waste   of   time   unless   you   love   cars .
202829854	2178	4.0	guy   ritchie   is   definitely   my   favourite   director    -    hands   down .    the   dialogue   is   extremely   dry   and   makes   me   laugh   non - stop .    this   was   the   first   of   jason   stathom ['] s   movies   that   i ['] d   seen   and   he   delivers   and   excellent   role .    i   wish   i   spoke   a   little   bit   more   british   slang   but   i   hung   on   to   the   dialogue   enough   to   enjoy   it    ( the   part   where   they   use   subtitles   is   fuckin   hilarious )  .    just   like   most   ritchie   movies ,    there   are   a   lot   of   side   stories   that   tie   together   at   the   end .    i ['] m   a   total   sucker   for   that   type   of   layout   so   this   is   on   my   top   10   list   of   all   time .    if   you   like   snatch ,    you   will   love   this .    enjoy .
202829854	758	3.0	surprisingly   good    " teen   movie "  .    i   guess   it ['] s   considered   a   teen   movie ,    maybe   more   like   a    " tween   movie "  .    i   think   this   is   rachel   mcadams    ( of   notebook   fame )    first   movie .    well ,    maybe   she   was   in   more   when   she   was   younger .  . i   don ['] t   really   care .    the   movie   pretty   much   shows   how   being   naive   and   outspoken   in   high   school   is   a   really   bad   idea .    still ,    worth   watching .    go   in   thinking   it ['] s   going   to   suck   and   you ['] ll   be   happy   when   you   leave .
202829854	571	5.0	one   of   the   best   movies   of   all   time   in   my   opinion .    kind   of   a   breakthrough   role   for   thora   birch   and   mena   suvari .    kevin   spacey   is   fantastic   in   this   movie   and   this   is   quite   possibly   his   best   job   to   date .    the   plot ,    cinematography   and   acting   are   all   bang   on .    if   you   haven ['] t   seen   this   movie   you ['] re   missing   a   good   one    -    rent   it   today .
202829854	7057	3.5	not   as   good   as   the   first .    understood   that   the   movie   has   to   follow   the   book   and   there ['] s   a   lull   to   be   expected   in   the   midway   point   of   a   book .    the   action   tends   to   slow   down   and   the   side   stories   are   picked   apart   more .       anyway ,    by   the   end   of   the   movie   the   action   really   picks   up   and   really   entices   you   but   then   it   ends .  . i   hate   it   when   that   happens .    the   movie   is   still   visually   stunning   and   the   acting   is   right   on   par .    i ['] ve   started   watching   the   third   and   things   are   really   tying   in   but   i ['] ll   wait   til   the   end   to   really   decide .
202829854	2452	4.5	ok ,    so   almost   4   years   after   this   movie   was   released ,    i   finally   watch   it .    of   course   you   hear   that   it ['] s   an   awesome   movie   and   that   it ['] ll   be   a   classic ,    yadda   yadda   yadda .    well ,    it   really   is   quite   amazing .    i ['] m   sure   this   is   how   people   felt   back   in   the   70s   with   the   star   wars   phenomenon .    the   movie   is   of   course   based   on   jrr   tolkien ['] s   famous   novel   so   the   plot   is   fantastic .    i ['] m   not   sure   how   true   to   the   book   it   is   since   i   haven ['] t   read   the   book   but   i ['] m   sure   that   i   would   have   heard   bad   things   about   the   movie   if   it   weren ['] t .    lets   be   honest ,    this   movie   itself   is   3   hours ,    not   to   mention   the   sequels ,    so   it   can ['] t   be   that   far   off   pace .    anyway ,    there ['] s   really   not   much   else   to   say .    this   is   the   biggest   must - see   movie   for   this   era .    there ['] s   no   question   but   to   watch   it .    i ['] m   going   to   watch   the   sequels   sometime   this   week .
202829854	6400	3.5	surprisingly   good   movie .    i   really   didn ['] t   like   dicaprio   in   the   past   but   this   was   the   first   of   his   movies   that   i   enjoyed .    hanks   and   dicaprio   actually   look   quite   good   playing   against   each   other .    it ['] s   a   typical   spielberg   film   that   tends   to   focus   on   the   story   more   than   developing   characters   and   teaching   the   viewer .    all   in   all ,    a   pretty   damn   good   film .
202829854	6844	3.5	this   movie   is   responsible   for   the   explosion   of   sooped - up   japanese   imported   cars .    the   movie   is   really   all   about   the   cars   although   the   story   that   accompanies   the   high   octane   rice   rockets   is   pretty   decent .    vin   diesel   really   makes   the   movie   and   paul   walker   isn ['] t   nearly   as   bad   as   he   normally   is   as   a   support .    there   have   now   been   two   sequels   to   this   movie   which   shows   how   popular   it   was .    check   this   one   out   long   before   you   watch   the   other   two .    definitely   the   best   car   movie   i ['] ve   ever   seen .
202829854	4432	4.0	i   really   enjoyed   this   movie .    who   would   have   thought   marky   mark   was   so   good   on   screen .    the   cast   is   pretty   phenomenol   including   theron ,    sutherland   and   norton .    this   is   another   remake   and   is   probably   better   than   the   original .  . but   i   haven ['] t   seen   the   original .  . so   i   can ['] t   really   say   that .    anyway ,    the   movie   is   action   packed   and   very   well   put   together .    definitely   recommended .
202829854	15755	4.0	classic   movie   for   my   generation .    this   was   tom   hank ['] s   biggest   hit   at   the   time .  . unless   you   consider   splash   a   hit    -    i   didn ['] t .    the   premise   is   a   good   one   and   the   acting   is   bang   on .    it   has   it ['] s   ups   and   down   emotionally   and   leaves   you   with   a   lasting   impression .    recommended   to   anyone   who   doesn ['] t   mind   watching   90s - grade   video   quality .
202829854	6235	3.0	defiinitely   cheesefest   but   i   still   liked   it .    i   think   mandy   moore   is   adorable   and   can ['] t   help   but   be   loved .    of   course ,    she   is   a   god - awful   actress   which   doesn ['] t   add   anything   to   this   movie .    the   plot   is   actually   pretty   interesting   but   was   badly   executed .    it   almost   had   a   made - for - tv   type   feel   to   it .    if   you   feel   like   snuggling   up   and   watching   a   cute   movie   with   a   loved   one   this   could   be   your   movie .
202829854	533	1.5	what   an   annoying   and   frustrating   movie .    you   can ['] t   help   but   feel   for   poor   cates   but   the   movie   is   so   ridiculous   you   get   over   it   quickly .    stupid   slapstick   humour   and   overly   raunchy   jokes   make   this   movie   completely   worthless .    quite   possibly   my   least   favourite   movie   of   all   time .
202829854	1865	3.5	well ,    i   thought   this   movie   would   blow   just   like   99 %    of   the   other   indie   movies   out   there .    i   can ['] t   really   consider   this   an   indie   flick   because   of   the   cast   though .    there   is   great   chemistry   on   set   and   carrey   is   a   standout   from   his   typical   role   as   a   comedian .    it   sure   makes   up   for   that   crapfest   the   majestic    ( the   first   non - comedy   he   put   out .  . i   think )  .    it ['] s   very   romantic   but   can   be   really   goddamn   annoying   when   they ['] re   both   being   so   freaking   stubborn .    go   watch   it .
202829854	5571	2.0	you   haven ['] t   seen   rocky ?    everyone ['] s   seen   rocky .    it ['] s   actually   pretty   good .    stallone   is   intelligeable   but   the   emotions   are   right   in   place .    watch   it .
202829854	16879	2.5	god ,    this   used   to   be   your   be   all   end   all   movie .    you   can ['] t   deny   the   onscreen   chemistry .    this   is   a   real   tear   jerker   which   everyone   needs   once   in   a   while .    i   hate   rating   this   any   higher   than   2   because   i   just   don ['] t   like   how   huge   this   goddamn   movie   was .    and   that   stupid   celine   song .  . god   i ['] m   glad   i   don ['] t   hear   that   on   the   radio   anymore .    oh   wait .  . yes   i   do .    fuck   you   celine !    i ['] m   adding   a   half   star .
202829854	6974	4.0	so   i   watched   this   for   about   the   fifth   time   last   night .    i ['] m   a   sucker   for   a   murder / mystery   and   this   one   is   really   great   for   the   genre .    spacey   is   incredible   as   usual   and   the   supporting   cast   does   a   great   job   as   well .    you   probably   won ['] t   see   the   end   coming   but   then   again   maybe   you   will .    a   definite   must   see   and   high   up   on   my   own   personal   top   10 .

202829854	17703	4.0	incredible   cgi   is   what   makes   this   movie .    anyone   who   has   a   brief   knowledge   of   comic   books   has   a   decent   idea   of   what ['] s   going   to   happen .    in   other   words    -    no   real   surpises .    that   is   as   far   as   the   storyline   is   concerned .    the   acting   however    -    quite   possibly   unsurpassed .    eric   bana   plays   the   role   as   if   lou   ferigno    ( or   however   the   fuck   you   spell   it )    hismelf .    jennifer   connelly   is   stunning   as   his   love   interest .    all   in   all   good   fun   action - packed   film .    doesn ['] t   get   5   stars   because   of   the   predictability   and   the   length .

351731887	12355	4.0	this   film   is   not   only   directed   by   steven   spielberg ,    but   is   highly   entertaining .    epic ,    although   perhaps   slightly   overlong .    a   good   idea   though ,    and   also   makes   many   film   fans   shed   a   small   tear - or   a   big   one   for   that   matter .    hayley   joel   osment   is   classic ,    just   as   he   was   in   sixth   sense .
351731887	11077	2.5	the   2nd   film   is   the   worst .    meet   the   family   was   much   better   than   this .    the   jokes   are   too   old ,    and   they ['] ve   all   been   done   before .    also ,    the   fact   robert   de   niro   is   in   it   makes   it   worthwhile ,    but   not   special .

351731887	4043	4.0	i   have   2   questions :    if   the   aliens   are   harmed   by   water ,    why   try   to   invade   a   planet   that   is   3 / 4   water ?    if   the   aliens   are   so   powerful ,    how   come   they   don ['] t   blow   everything   up ?    seriously ,    if   you   want   to   defend   your   house   from   these   aliens   all   you   need   is   a   garden   hose !    it   made   no   logical   sense ,    although   a   lot   of   the   film   was   generally   frightening .    also ,    mel   gibson   seems   to   know   way   too   much   about   the   aliens   for   his   own   good ,    and   the   kid   is   so   irritating .    however ,    it   is   brilliantly   frightening   and   is   a   true   classic .    that   scene   with   the   alien   at   the   boy ['] s   party ,    man   its   freaky !
351731887	8301	1.5	sorry ,    was   this   film   meant   to   be   funny ?    what   exactly   happened   here   i   don ['] t   know ,    because   it   was   a   good   idea .    this   was   not   what   i   expected ,    and   certainly   not   from   eddie   murphy !    the   acting   is   unconvincing ,    the   jokes   aren ['] t   funny ,    and   we   should   all   be   thankful   it   was   over   so   soon   and   that   it   wasn ['] t   a   long   film !
351731887	11929	3.5	i   never   thought   a   snake   film   like   this   would   be   any   good ,    but   i   was   proven   wrong .    it ['] s   well   done   and   although   at   times   the   sfx   are   a   little   shoddy ,    overall   its   an   enjoyable   enough   ride .    j - lo   is   no   actor   though ,    but   jon   voight   is   pretty   good   in   this .    great   satisfaction   in   seeing   owen   wilson   killed   by   a   huge   snake .    made   my   day ,    that .

351731887	13342	3.0	enjoyable   enough ,    if   not   terribly   original .    the   wise   cracks   of   sean   william   scott   make   it   worthwhile ,    but   its   still   blatantly   average .    it   doesn ['] t   pretend   to   be   anything   other   than   an   action   movie ,    and   a   pretty   good   action   movie   at   that .    you   have   to   ask   yourself   though ,    if   it ['] s   worth   watching   twice ,    because   1   watch   is   enough   to   fully   enjoy   it .    if   you   watch   it   more   than   twice ,    you   start   to   notice   flaws   in   the   story .    still ,    enjoyable   enough   to   watch ,    but   don ['] t   rent   it   out .

351731887	6119	3.0	wow ,    the   farelly   brothers   have   made   a   film   where   they ['] ve   avoided   both   jim   carrey   and   ben   stiller !    this   is   something   to   shout   about ,    although   it   does   have   matt   damon   in   it .    surprisingly ,    this   film   was   funny ,    and   it   was   majorly   hyped   when   it   came   down .    i   didn ['] t   think   it   was   amazing ,    but   i ['] d   watch   it   again ,    it ['] s   fun   and   hides   a   great   moral !    awww ,    brotherly   love !
351731887	6287	2.5	i   never   saw   the   appeal   of   this   film ,    but   julia   roberts   looks   good   in   those   boots ,    regardless   of   anything   else .    however ,    i   still   don ['] t   think   this   film   is   worth   of   your   time .
351731887	6972	3.5	although   deep   impact   is   very   alike ,    this   film   stood   its   own .    a   sci - fi   classic ,    and   filled   with   action   and   a   character   death   that   shows   a   fathers   love   for   his   daughter .    the   aerosmith   song ,     ['] i   don ['] t   wanna   miss   a   thing [']  ,    was   ideal   for   this   film ,    really   depicting   the   mood .    not   quite   legendary ,    but   darn   close   to   it .
351731887	58	3.0	beautiful ,    like   the   sequel ,    there   is   so   much   emotion   in   it .    i   love   these   films ,    they   really   are   my   guilty   pleasures .    makes   dragons   look   good   for   once ,    which   seems   somehow   right !    love   it .  .  .
351731887	16565	3.5	full   credit   to   kevin   spacey ,    whom   i   had   never   rated   much   as   an   actor .    but   in   this ,    mr   spacey   really   excells   as   does   the   supporting   cast .    although   the   ending   is   left   very   ambiguous   as   to   the   fate   of   prot ,    that   only   adds   to   the   feeling   of   mystery   about   the   k - paxian .    interpret   this   movie   how   you   want ,    there   is   no   denying   that   it   has   a   charm   that   cannot   be   ignored   and   is   certainly   a   watchable   enough .    not   a   classic ,    but   certainly   a   good   watch   if   you   happen   to   come   across   it .
351731887	1138	4.0	ok ,    so   by   now   you   may   have   figured   that   i ? m   a   fan   of   versus   movies   and   mixing   franchises   together .    whereas   most   people   shun   franchise   mixing ,    i   support   and   endorse   it   as   a   way   to   keep   dying   franchises   going .    for   example ,    both   jason   and   freddy   were   characters   of   the   past   and   only   by   creating   a    ? vs .  ?    could   both   characters   be   reincarnated   for   the   new   millennium .    this   works   well ,    though ,    in   the   main   part   because   it   means   we   get   plenty   of   blood   and   dippy   teenagers   getting   chopped   up   by   jason .    we   also   get   robert   englund   as   the   infamous   freddy   krueger ,    using   jason   to   kill   so   he   doesn ? t   have   to    ( like   mr   muscle   doing   the   jobs   you   hate )  .    mixing   franchises   together ,    although   difficult ,    is   also   a   way   to   mean   we   get   two   iconic   characters   in   one   movie .    also ,    we   are   treated   to   one   of   the   bloodiest   and   over   the   top   battles   between   two   murderers   ever   put   onto   a   film   screen .    by   the   end ,    you ? re   almost   screaming   for   twenty   minutes   more   action   between   the   two   murderers .

351731887	3925	4.0	best   of   the   trilogy ,    even   better   than   the   first .    the   third   didn ['] t   live   up   to   expectations ,    but   this   did .    good   fighting ,    good   general   action ,    and   the   usual   matrix   moves .    utterly   pleasurable   to   watch ,    and   strangely   addictive .    brilliance !
351731887	17405	3.0	ok ,    so   enjoyable   enough ,    and   penelope   cruz   is   gorgeous ,    but   i   just   felt   unsatisfied .    why ?    i   don ['] t   know ,    but   it   needed   a   little   bit   more .    still ,    as   the   dvd   boxes   say ,    johnny   vaughan   liked   it .    is   that   good   or   bad   though ?    average ,    thats   it .
351731887	2372	4.0	this   is   where   the   bourne   story   starts   to   get   interesting ,    with   bourne   being   pushed   to   the   limits   once   again .    a   mix   of   action   and   emotion    ( the   scene   where   his   woman   gets   shot   springs   to   mind )  ,    this   film   took   off   where   the   last   one   left   off   beautifully !    karl   urban   owns   as   the   assasin   without   a   name   and   matt   damon   is   once   again   spectacular ,    but   special   note   has   to   go   to   the   brilliantly   worked   car   chase   scene !    a   great   2nd   movie !
351731887	6037	3.5	this   is   where   quite   possibly   the   ultimate   trilogy   began ,    and   boy   wasn ['] t   it   good !    from   the   spy   breaking   through   the   window   with   a   machine   gun   and   being   owned   by   bourne   and   a   biro   pen   to   the   chase   with   a   mini   through   the   streets   of   france ,    this   film   had   everything   that   a   good   action   film   buff   could   possibly   want .    matt   damon   is   the   man ,    and   clive   owen   makes   a   nice   appearance   as   the   assasin   sent   to   kill   bourne .    great   action   and   a   great   opening   to   the   trilogy !

351731887	16469	4.0	i   loved   predator   but   not   so   much   the   alien   franchise ,    but   this   film   did   justice   and   did   not   disregard   the   back   stories   of   either   of   the   intergalactic   creatures .    the   action   was   pretty   intense   and   although   short ,    this   film   delivered   an   epic   sense   of   scale   and   terror   but   sometimes   the   sfx   are   disappointing   to   say   the   least .    however ,    it   was   the   charm   of   the   original   movies   that   sometimes   the   effects   were   shoddy   and   so   you   can   forgive   this   movie   for   staying   true   to   its   roots .    watching   it   a   first   time   made   it   seem   disappointing ,    but   watching   it   a   second   time   and   later   a   third   made   me   realise   that   its   everything   an   alien   or   predator   fan   would   want   even   if   they   don ? t   expect   it   at   first .

351731887	2396	4.0	this   film   i   can   remember   watching   as   a   kid   when   i   was   young   and   just   thinking   it   was   a   blood   and   guts   war   movie   set   in   the   future .    that   suited   me   fine   as   a   child ,    but   having   watched   this   i   now   realise   the   view   on   society   it   is   giving .    it   works   on   so   many   levels   as   a   movie -    either   a   straight   up   action   movie   or   a   deeper   meaning .    either   way ,    starship   troopers   impacted   me   like   no   other   film   and   brought   about   quotes   that   i   still   use   to   this   day .    it ? s   cheesy   and   predictable ,    but   you   realise   that   is   the   whole   intention   when   you   watch   this   a   few   times   through .

612744307	15063	1.0	this   movie   was   a   disgrace   to   the   noble   name   of   comedy .    an   over   used   theme   of   men   dressing   up   as   women ,    falling   for   women   and   eventually   even   getting   the   women .    it   had   a   few   moments ,    obviously   and   was   not   without   its   merits   but   unless   you   are   flat   out   on   a   hospital   bed   on   a   morphine   drip ,    foaming   from   the   mouth   and   staring   into   the   jaws   of   death   itself ,    you   will   probably   not   find   it   funny .  .  . however ,    i   may   simply   have   no   sense   of   humour .

612744307	9645	3.0	quite   funny .    eddie   murphey   would   be   a   cool   dad .    except   for   anjelica   huston   scaring   the   little   children   i   would   recommend   it

612744307	10928	2.5	very   funny   film ,    obvious   over - acting   on   the   part   of   jim   carrey   but   that   was   to   be   expected .

612744307	758	2.5	an   okay   film   with   typical   american   humour ,    and   acting .    a   good   chick - flick   to   watch   with   the   girls   and   a   fairly   good   story - line
612744307	14858	3.0	aw ,    the   little   talking   piggie .    watch   this   movie   and   you   will   become   a   vegetarian .  .  . trust   me .
612744307	1962	1.0	not   particularly   good ,    but   then   adam   sandler   and      drew   barrymore .  .  . it   was   doomed   before   it   was   filmed .
612744307	14050	0.5	freakier   than   the   newer   one    ( and   that   was   directed   by   tim   burton !  )    there   is   something   decidedly   wrong   about   willy   wonka .  .  .
612744307	2400	1.0	god ,    when   will   they   ever   stop ?    what   posessed   them   to   do   number   one   let   alone   numbers   2 , 3   and   was   there   even   a   4 ?  !

612744307	16377	5.0	tom   hanks   did   a   fabulous   enactment   of   a   police   warden   overlooking   death   row .    it   was   absolutely   stunning   and   very   touching .

255346254	11077	5.0	so   funny   and   much   of   an   improvement   on   meet   the   parents ,    i   love   the   both   just   remember   you   have   to   watch   the   first   one   to   get   the   jokes   in   the   second
255346254	15107	4.5	i   love   the   way   they   conduct   the   roberry   and   how   its   all   planned ,    only   bad   point   is   it   can   be   hard   to   follow
255346254	1905	4.0	i   like   jack   sparrow   great   character   and   more   humurous   than   i   thought   it   would   be   a   definite   must   watch
255346254	3938	5.0	this   is   so   funny ,    its   the   funniest   thing   since   austin   powers ,    if   you   liked   the   first   this   one   is   a   guarantee   to   please
255346254	15063	1.0	hehe   another   cheesy   comedy   with   a   storyline   lacking   of   any   thought   or   credability
255346254	10928	1.0	another   cheesy   comedy ,    not   worth   the   time
255346254	16969	1.0	everything   about   this   film   i   felt   was   poor ,    the   acting   the   storyline   everything   way   overrated
255346254	13610	2.0	another   kids   one ,    but   its   something   to   see   when   you   have   nothing   to   do
255346254	10583	5.0	damn   awesome   film   with   jack   black   from   tenacious   d   rocking   it   on   with   a   bunch   of   awesome   kids   in   a   bid   to   win   some   money ,    but   it   becomes   more   than   that   as   time   goes   on .  .  .
255346254	17324	4.0	very   funny   will   smith   has   made   a   great   comeback   after   some   terrible   films
255346254	7664	5.0	beatiful   scenery   and   compelling   story   and   i   love   enyas   music ,    especially   for   the   mood   of   this   film ,
255346254	5571	5.0	a   personal   favourite   when   i   wacthed   it   i   got   caught   in   the   fight   and   was   enthrawled   by   the   way   they   added   the   suspense
255346254	16879	4.0	bit   soppy   but   overall   it ['] s   an   ok   film   a   bit   exaggerated   on   the   actual   story ,    dont   watch   it   if   you   want   factual   information    : p
255346254	11337	1.0	a   cheesey   american   comedy   with   nothing   much   backing   it ,    still   it   has   it ['] s   moments ,    personally   i   think   it   would   be   better   as   a   series   over   a   film
255346254	7032	3.5	im   more   of   a   fan   of   the   old   episodes ,    if   you   really   liked   the   1st   and   2nd   the   3rd   is   slightly   dissapointing

800253750	14691	2.0	believe   it   or   not ,    much   of   this   has   been   treated   in   another   movie   that   i ['] m   still   trying   to   track   down   again .    they   overthink   the   plumbing ,    so   to   speak .     " dark   city "    is   so   much   better !
800253750	2985	1.0	nasty
800253750	3463	4.0	the   shakespearean   element   appeals   to   me ,    and   it   is   cleverly   done .    heath ['] s    " you ['] re   just   too   good   to   be   true "    is   a   terrific   scene !
800253750	15107	2.0	i   prefer   the   original .
800253750	3938	2.0	more   plastic   images ~ i   thought   puss   in   boots   would   have   more   of   a   role .
800253750	14103	3.0	not   as   impressive   as   the   adulation   led   me   to   believe
800253750	15063	2.0	stupid
800253750	4472	2.0	ok
800253750	7521	2.0	weak   parody
800253750	10928	2.0	ok   but   beyond   dumb
800253750	17479	5.0	it ['] s   an   excellent   horror   mystery   film   with   a   satisfying   sequel .
800253750	13610	3.0	the   cgi   isn ['] t   as   effective   as   in   the   second   film ,    but   this   is   a   good   translation ,    even   if   i   don ['] t   care   for   tobey   mcguire .
800253750	10583	2.0	cute   but   irritating   at   times
800253750	2457	2.0	ok
800253750	3962	2.0	i   hate   plastic - looking   animation   and   being   drowned   in   cliches !
800253750	17324	2.0	almost   ok
800253750	7664	2.0	how   many   historical   details   can   we   get   absolutely   wrong ?    this   may   go   for   a   record .    the   cgi   backgrounds   are   murky   and   unconvincing .    crowe ~ yuck !
800253750	11337	1.0	so - so   with   strained   laughs
800253750	5239	1.0	ok
800253750	12471	2.0	barely   ok ~ i   don ['] t   care   for   most   rap .
800253750	1962	2.0	the   two   stars   are   for   drew .    i   wish   she   could   have   had   a   different   leading   man .
800253750	15205	3.0	irwin   allen - type   disaster   but   without   falling   into   allen ['] s   weaknesses
800253750	8989	2.0	cliche   from   the   get - go
800253750	3320	5.0	i   haven ['] t   seen   this   for   a   while ,    but   i   still   recall   the   excellent   performances   and   quirky   story .
800253750	6235	2.0	ok
800253750	16879	2.0	two   stars   is   a      generous   rating .    i   disllike   this   film   on   so   many   levels ,    especially   the   very   poor   script .
800253750	6287	2.0	i   detest   julia   roberts !    the   story   is   sappy   and   unbelievable .    but ,    richard   gere   earns   it   at   least   two   stars .
800253750	7032	1.0	nasty   and   not   very   funny ;    worthwhile   for   co - stars ~ mike   myers = yuck !
800253750	3860	2.0	ok
800253750	5991	4.5	powerful ,    mesmerizing ,    visually   stunning ;    half - star   off   for   jessica   alba ,    the   non - actress
800253750	3579	1.0	an   action   film   can ['] t   be   simply   a   melee .
73007655	7381	3.5	ahhh ,    another   classic ,    flubber   looks   soooo   cool ,    but   i   hate   it   how   that   yellow   robot   thing   dies    :  [']  (  .

73007655	12074	4.0	well ,    a   movie   with   annoying   music   that   gets   stuck   in   your   head    # raindrops   on   roses   and   blue   kitchen   mittens ,    brown   paper   packages   tied   up   with   strings ,    these   are   a   few   of   my   favourite   things .  .  .  #       but   yeah   good   movie .

373681146	5571	3.5	good   film
373681146	6287	1.5	not   too   bad   but   not   really   my   cup   of   tea
373681146	11337	1.5	annoying   basically   saying   that   if   you   try   and   have   sex   bad   things   will   happen   to   you ,    that ['] s   hardly   an   outrageous   film
373681146	7032	3.5	not   seen   it   for   ages   but   it   was   pretty   funny
373681146	5239	1.5	watched   it   and   got   annoyed   cos   it   was   shit

373681146	5991	3.5	good   but   tohught   it   was   too   long
194484865	12940	3.5	very   scary ,    but   a   bit   unsatisfying .
194484865	6394	1.5	you   roasted   marshmellows   on   a   pile   of   flaming   gonads ?  ?  ?
194484865	2412	3.5	finally   someone   who   brings   a   little   inspiration   to   the   series .     :  )

194484865	2743	5.0	excellent .    captures   a   very   real   fear   and   a   very   human ,    very   great   tragedy   in   a   way   unequaled   by   any   other   film .
194484865	16516	2.0	starts   out   like   a   witty ,    sharp   indie   thriller ,    then   degenerates   into   pure ,    despicable   shit .
194484865	10451	4.0	never   used   to   like   this   one   until   i   recently   saw   it   theatrically ,    and   for   some   reason   it   just   clicked .

194484865	3505	3.5	sometimes   this   movie   is   funny   as   hell .

228332304	15107	3.0	i   liked   this   movie .       i   mean   the   classic   rat   pack   version   from   the   60s   is   a   classic   and   this   one   does   the   classic   well .
228332304	1905	4.0	i ['] m   looking   foward   to   the   sequel .       again   johnny   depp   never   fails   to   impress .
228332304	3938	3.5	funny ,    not   as   good   as   the   original   in   my   opinion ,    but   still   good   fun   to   watch .
228332304	14103	3.5	i   actually   liked   this   movie .       didn ['] t   think   i   would   at   first   but   it   grew   on   me .
228332304	15063	1.5	black   men   as   white   women .  .  . oooo .  .  . kay .  .  .
228332304	4472	3.0	it   was   okay .

228332304	17479	1.5	ah .  .  . okay   i   guess .
228332304	13610	4.0	wilem   dafoe   as   the   green   goblin   was   great .
228332304	10583	3.0	being   a   student   of   music   i   can   appreciate   this   movie .
228332304	2457	1.5	it   was   alright
228332304	3962	5.0	i   like   animation   movies .       this   one   is   good .
228332304	2463	5.0	a   new   animation   classic .
228332304	17324	3.5	i   like   will   smith ['] s   movies   so   far .       this   one   is   no   exception .
228332304	7664	2.5	not   bad .       not   one   of   my   favs   but   it   will   do .
228332304	11337	3.5	not   bad .  .  . one   time   at   band   camp .  .  .
228332304	5239	2.5	prefer   the   orginal   much   more   then   this   remake
228332304	12471	1.5	ah .  . it   was   okay
228332304	11077	4.0	i   hope   my   future   in - laws   aren ['] t   like   this .
228332304	2782	3.5	a   movie   you   have   to   be   in   the   mood   to   watch .       it   is   good ,    but   you   have   to   be   ready   for   it .
228332304	15205	3.0	why   do   american   disaster   movies   always   neglect   canada ?
228332304	8989	1.5	nah .  . i ['] ll   pass .
228332304	16969	1.5	i   can   take   it   or   leave   it .
228332304	6235	2.5	i   prefer   mandy   moore ['] s   acting   as   opposed   to   her   singing .       this   movie   wasn ['] t   bad .
228332304	16879	4.0	thought   the   special   effects   were   good .       wasn ['] t   impressed   with   dicaprio ['] s   acting .       but   kathy   bates   as   always   was   great   to   watch .
228332304	6287	4.0	it   was   good .       i ['] m   usually   not   a   julia   roberts   fan   but   she   does   good   in   this   one .
228332304	3860	4.0	well   i   grew   up   with   channel   7   news   as   a   kid   so   i   can   appreciate   all   the   western   new   york   references .       and   anything   with   morgan   freeman   in   it   is   always   good .
228332304	5991	1.5	it   was   okay .       didn ['] t   do   much   for   me   overall .
228332304	3579	1.5	okay ,    not   specatular .       but   it ; ll   do .
781660927	205	0.5	if   i   remember   correctly   brad   pitt   declined   to   star   in   aronofsky ['] s    ['] the   fountain [']    to   star   in   this   turd .       duh .
781660927	2422	4.0	those   shameless    ['] on   the   lot [']    contestants   need   to   bask   in   the   greatness   of   this   ultra - low   budget   work   of   genius .        $ 8 , 000   was   the   budget .  .  .    dude ,    i   could   make   a   film   for    $ 8000   but   it   wouldn ['] t   look   nearly   as   good   nor   be   nearly   as   compelling   as   this   brainteaser   time - travel   odyssey .  .  .    which   contrary   to   some   opinion   actually   makes   sense   in   every   way   but   it   takes   a   lot   of   thinking   to   figure   it   out .
781660927	1595	4.5	they   don ['] t   come   much   better   than   this .       this   is   my   casablanca ,    a   nicely   told   yarn   in   vienna   with   a   great   cameo   by   orson   welles ,    an   interesting   plot ,    zither   music ,    and   perhaps   the   best   black   and   white   photography   ever   filmed .
781660927	8636	0.5	can   i   give   a   zero   review .  .  .    yeah   i   think   so .       possibly   the   single   worst   film   experience   i   have   had .       absolute   drivel .       let   the   record   show   i   want   to   give   no   stars   for   this   but   am   not   allowed   to .
786632306	1703	2.5	this   was   rather   stupid   and   pointless .       we ['] ve   all   heard   the   story ,    this   was   just   a   bad   twist   on   it .
786632306	8743	2.0	too   childish   for   my   tastes .
786632306	3463	3.0	too   dramatic   for   me ,    but   good .
786632306	8333	2.0	all   scare   and   no   story .
786632306	1905	3.0	not   really   a   johnny   depp   fan .       but   this   was   pretty   good   nonetheless .
786632306	3938	3.0	i   don ['] t   really   care   for   animation .
786632306	9628	3.0	i   don ['] t   really   like   the   first   three   that   were   made .       but   since   this   is   the   last   of   the   original   three ,    it ['] s   the   better   of   them   because   it ['] s   more   updated   in   terms   of   special   effects .
786632306	7521	2.5	not   really   my   type   of   humor .
786632306	10928	1.5	jim   carrey   is   not   that   funny   to   me .
786632306	10170	2.5	blah .
786632306	11663	3.5	awesome .
786632306	17479	3.0	was   more   freaky   than   anything .       could   have   been   better .
786632306	13610	4.0	it ['] s   fricken   spiderman   dude !
786632306	3962	3.0	was   okay   for   an   animation .
786632306	2457	3.5	it ['] s   okay   if   you   like   drama   and   happy   endings .
786632306	3151	0.5	the   supidest ,    most   unfunny   thing   ever !
786632306	7664	0.5	the   most   historically   inaccurate   movie   of   all   time .
786632306	11337	3.5	not   my   kind   of   humor .
786632306	5239	3.5	a   good   take   on   prison   sports .
786632306	758	4.0	this   is   a   good   movie   just   for   looking   at   the   girls .
786632306	12471	2.5	could   have   been   better .       maybe   if   it   took   the   whole    " stan "    storyline .
786632306	1962	3.0	for   an   adam   sandler   movie ,    it ['] s   pretty   okay .
786632306	7381	4.0	robin   williams   was   great   as   the   absent - minded   professor .
786632306	14203	3.5	this   was   an   entertaining   movie .
786632306	8636	4.0	angelina   jolie   in   spandex   is   awesome !
786632306	15205	2.5	not   really   good   to   me .
786632306	8989	3.5	had   a   good   story .       the   acting   pretty   much   sucked   though .
786632306	13315	3.5	the   first   two   make   me   feel   embarrassed   watching   them   because   they ['] re   so   young   and   their   voices   are   so   high .       but   when   i   first   saw   it ,    i   thought   it   was   great   and   was   true   to   the   book .
786632306	14670	4.5	da   na   na   na   na   na   batman !  !  !  !
786632306	1470	3.0	was   okay   for   a   drama .
786632306	6235	4.5	awesome .       that ['] s   all   i   have   to   say .
786632306	5571	2.5	i   don ['] t   really   enjoy   most   of   the   early   ones ,    but   the   newest   one   is   the   best .
786632306	6287	3.0	ehh .  .  .
786632306	7032	3.5	i   don ['] t   really   like   austin   powers ,    but   this   one   was   okay .

799707582	17482	4.0	love .    it .    one   of   the   first   things   paul   rudd   was   great   in ,    before   he   started   showing   up   every   where ,    in   everything ,    all   the   time .    i   un - ironically   love   this   movie .
799707582	3524	4.5	rewatching   this   movie   after   a   few   years ,    i   bumped   my   rating   up   a   half   star .    i   forgot   what   a   powerful   emotional   foundation   tarantino   built   this   film   on .    he   has   willingly   associated   himself   with   the   grindhouse   aesthetic ,    but   pulp   fiction   is   much   more   than   that .    the   ending   is   so   hopeful ,    even   in   spite   of   what   we   know   will   come .
799707582	6437	0.5	this   came   up   on   my   quick   rate ,    and   i   actually   just   finished   watching   it   on   the   family   channel .    it   was   awful .    awful .    it   was   pointlessly   stylized   and   narratively   foggy .    the   cgi   boogey   man   at   the   end :    i ['] m   pretty   sure   he   was   wearing   an   argyle   sweater   and   hoody ,    which   is   arguable   the   best   part   of   this   one .    it ['] s   so   much   fun   to   hate   on   bad   film .
799707582	15421	4.0	again :    i   love   alan   rickman .    add   kate   winslet   and   emma   thompson ,    and   yes .    you   have   an   excellent   movie .
799707582	11283	3.5	everytime   this   movie   is   on ,    i   watch   it .    i   still   love   it   and   wish   robin   wright - penn   was   in   more   good   films .
799707582	7416	4.5	i   mean ,    c ['] mon .    it ['] s   gone   with   the   wind .    half   a   point   of   for   being   so   long .
799707582	15887	1.0	oh ,    van   helsing .    you   make   me   laugh   and   laugh   and   laugh .  .  .
799707582	13610	2.0	whatever .    one   thing   you   can   say   for   the   spiderman   movies ,    is   that   they   cast   really   interesting ,    talented   actors   as   villians    ( alfred   molina !  !  !  )     -  -    unfortunately   they   then   squander   their   talents .    boooooo .    good   thing   raimi   made   the   evil   dead   movies .    you   can ['] t   ever   give   up   on   the   man   who   brought   us   ash .
799707582	14574	2.0	remember   how   dave   chappelle   is   the   perfuntory   black   friend ?    i ['] m   glad   he   doesn ['] t   have   to   take   those   roles   anymore .
799707582	13614	4.0	classic .    support   texas   film - makers   y ['] all .
799707582	16640	4.0	the   feel   bad   movie   to   end   all   feel   bad   movies .    i   can ['] t   watch   this   often ,    and   when   i   do ,    i   can ['] t   talk   to   anyone   for   the   rest   of   the   day .    that   said ,    it ['] s   so   well   done   and   so   absorbing ,    it   almost   makes   up   for   the   complete   misanthropy   it   breeds   in   me .
799707582	16768	2.0	i   liked   it   better   when   it   was    " heathers .  "
799707582	30	3.0	this   movie   made   my   mom   laugh ,    so   i   like   it   for   that .
799707582	2874	3.5	i   enjoy   this   cheese - fest   and   i ['] m   not   afraid   to   admit   it .    it   has   both   zooey   deschanel   and   amy   sedaris ,    so   i   feel   somewhat   redeemed .
799707582	4506	3.5	i ['] m   not   going   to   pick   a   fight   with   this   movie .    it ['] s   a   classic   and   would   totally   own   me .    also ,    i   own   the   dvd .
799707582	1406	3.0	yessssss .
799707582	12161	3.5	yes ,    i   did   cry   the   first    -  -    and   second    -  -    time   i   saw   this .    maybe   it ['] s   sappy ,    but   i   can ['] t   find   a   way   to   fault   it   for   that .    also ,    check   out   loudon   wainwright   iii ['] s   turn   as   the   ever - optimistic   mayor .
799707582	311	4.5	it ['] s   sweet   and   weird   and   unapologetic .    it   helps   one   understand ,    if   only   in   a   semi - fictional   setting ,    how   one   man   could   make   so   many   awful   movies .
799707582	17308	3.0	i   would   like   to   say   i   didn ['] t   like   this ,    but   everytime   it   comes   on   tbs   i    " accidentally "    end   up   watching   it .
799707582	3917	2.0	i ['] m   going   to   say   it :    this   movie   is   way   overrated .    it ['] s   a   pretty   typical   rom - com   format   with   a   soundtrack   of   great   songs   that   were   all   about   two   years   old   at   the   time   this   was   released .    however ,    i   will   always   love   me   some   ian   holm .
799707582	13315	3.0	it ['] s   painful   to   watch   the   kids   act .    maybe   that ['] s   mean .    as   an   adaptation ,    it   works   pretty   well .
799707582	9049	5.0	here ['] s   to   marky - mark   and   his   funky   bunch .    i   can   not   say   enough   good   things   about   this   film .
799707582	6531	4.5	paul   thomas   anderson   is   such   a   fantastic   film - maker ,    and   this   is   an   excellent   example   of   why .
799707582	15209	4.0	" that ['] s   the   thing   about   high   school   girls ,    i   keep   getting   older ,    but   they   stay   the   same   age .  .  .  "    creepy ?    yes .    most   excellent ?    definitely .
799707582	3905	4.0	even   after   you   know   the   ending ,    it ['] s   still   enjoyable .    that ['] s   a   significant   achievement   for   a   horror   film .    also ,    nicole   kidman   freaks   me   out .
799707582	5327	1.0	i   totally   watched   this   with   my   grandma .    it   was   her   idea .    it   was   awkward .
799707582	7624	2.0	great   thing   about   this   movie :    for   years   it   has   tricked   men   into   believing   that   they ['] re   really   not   watching   a   run - of - the - mill   chick   flick .    with   planes .
799707582	17181	3.0	not   romero ['] s   best   entry   into   the   zombie   mythology ,    but   i   kinda   like   it   just   for   making   a   place   for   dennis   hopper .
799707582	8038	3.5	" errr ,    gus - gus .  "
799707582	4355	3.5	" so ,    jack ,    are   you   going   to   tell   me   about   your   tesla      coil ?  "    that   about   sums   it   up .    i   mean   that   iin   a   good   way .
799707582	17050	1.0	those   wheeler   guys   still   freak   me   out .
799707582	11696	3.0	bonus   points   for   casting   alan   rickman .    minus   points   for   casting   tim   allen .
799707582	1865	4.0	more   movies   should   use   in - camera   special   effects .    this   is   moving   and   quirky   and   surprisingly   real   for   all   its   surrealism .    that   didn ['] t   make   sense ,    but   this   film   doesn ['] t   need   me   to   defend   it .
799707582	9518	2.0	jessie ['] s   big   breakthrough .    it ['] s   campy   enough   to   be   an   enjoyable   novelty    -  -    especially   if   you   love   strippers   who   beat   up   cars .
799707582	7635	3.5	will   ferrell   doing   what   he   do ,    back   when   it   still   seemed   new   and   exciting .    i   still   like   this   movie   and   quote   it   more   than   i ['] d   like   to   admit .
799707582	13580	4.0	perhaps   the   best   use   of   an   ensemble   cast .    jamie   lee   curtis   is   even   engaging .    isn ['] t   that   right ,    k - k - k - ken ?
799707582	9637	3.5	i   tried   to   not   like   it .    but   there ['] s   really   not   much   you   can   do ;    it ['] s   like   kryptonite   for   detached   disdain .
799707582	1144	2.0	i   watched   this   by   accident   one   especially   boring   saturday .    guh .
799707582	1518	2.0	i   had   a   huge   crush   on   the   real   life   caspar .    wow .    i   hadn ['] t   thought   about   that   one   in   awhile .
799707582	17764	1.5	if   you   want   to   die   a   little   inside ,    just   remember   that   1 )    gwyneth   paltrow   won   an   oscar   for   this ,    2 )    this   movie   won   best   picture ,    and   3 )    this   is   the   only   knowledge   of   tom   stoppard   some   people   have .
799707582	15366	5.0	again ,    come   over   and   watch   it   if   you   don ['] t   believe   me .    here   are   the   reasons   you ['] ll   love   it :    1 .    kurt   russell ['] s   flowing   mane   and   man - candy   beard .    2 .    ground - breaking   special   effects .    3 .    the   funniest   and   most - effective   uses   of   expletives   in   cinamatic   history .    4 .    flame .    thrower .    5 .    just .  .  . it ['] s   so   beautiful .
799707582	15078	3.5	i   freakin [']    loved   this   movie .  .  . when   i   was   9 .
799707582	205	1.5	i   don ['] t   remember   anything   about   this   movie ,    except   how   unnaturally   ripped   brad   pitt   is .    and   that   orlando   bloom   needed   a   good   punch   in   the   face .
799707582	1582	3.5	still   scares   me .    tim   curry ,    damn   you   for   haunting   my   nightmares !
799707582	9685	2.5	i   saw   this   once ,    but   i   don ['] t   remember   much .
799707582	15953	3.5	if   nothing   else ,    this   movie   always   helps   me   remember   how   to   spell   socrates .    oh ,    and   it ['] s   awesome .  .  . excellent ?    keanu   reeves [']    most   convincing   role .
799707582	1571	4.0	i   appreciate   the   way   this   film   humanizes   its   characters    -  -    a   usual   weakness   in   horror .
799707582	13894	1.5	guh .    i   guess   carrying   a   movie   by   yourself   is   pretty   impressive ,    and   i ['] m   not   one   to   hate   on   tom   hanks .    but   seriously .
799707582	2252	1.0	no .    artistic   lisence   is   one   thing ,    casting   keanu   reeves   as   the   lead   is   unconsciounable .    gary   oldman   is   always   great ,    but   this   movie   is   not    " bram   stoker ['] s "    if   it   violates   the   central   themes   of   the   novel .    c ['] mon ,    coppola ,    we   know   you ['] re   better   than   this .
799707582	14274	3.5	i   love   this   cast .    i   don ['] t   feel   the   movie   would   have   worked   without   it .
799707582	16340	1.5	i   understand   this   was   directed   at   a   younger   audience .    remembering   that   actually   makes   me   think   of   this   worse .
799707582	17387	4.0	this   film   deals   with   themes   that   have   the   potential   to   alienate   the   audience ;    instead ,    the   film   depicts   a   completely   sweet   and   touching   relationship .    like   everyone ,    the   leads   in   this   story   have   issues ,    but   they   are   lucky   enough   to   find   someone   who   compliments   them ,    rather   than   changing   them .    i   highly   recommend   this   film   to   anyone   willing   to   look   past   the   surface   sexual   stereotypes .
799707582	9298	2.5	okay ,    guys .    whatever .    i   feel   that   the   open   mind   i   maintained   through   this   movie   was   completely   for   nought   because   of   that   final   shot .    an   aztec   temple ?    what   the   hell .
799707582	329	4.0	my   favorite   kevin   smith   film .    only   he   could   find   a   place   for   a   giant   poo - monster   in   theological   musing .
799707582	2776	3.5	i   actually   liked   this   one .    i   thought   it   was   an   interesting   take   on   the   superhero   trope .
799707582	5112	3.0	i   was   scared   of   my   bathroom   for   the   rest   of   the   week .
799707582	5401	2.0	no   more   movies   for   you ,    ben   stiller .    vaughn ,    you ['] re   on   notice .
799707582	12293	5.0	quite   possibly   the   perfect   movie .
799707582	2783	2.5	this   movie   terrified   me   as   a   kid .    seriously .    bette   midler   eats   babies .
799707582	2412	4.0	oh ,    alfonso .
799707582	9591	0.5	i   tried ,    but   i   couldn ['] t   do   it .
799707582	494	4.0	this   won   the   grand   jury   prize   at   cannes .    i   just   like   remindiing   people   of   that   fact .
799707582	2554	3.5	the   first   time   i   saw   this ,    i   was   intrigued .    the   second   time   i   watched   this   i   thought   it   was   overrated .    the   third   time ,    i   loved   it .    so ,    loved   it   it   is .
799707582	9940	4.0	i   still   can ['] t   believe   this   movie   was   ever   made .    it ['] s   b   movie   in   quality ,    but   outstanding   in   every   other   aspect .
799707582	5151	4.0	who   knew   that   wwii   was   so   much   fun ?
799707582	5088	3.0	the   reason   i   gave   this   a   higher   rating   than   it   probably   deserves :    i   compulsive   say    " nobody   puts   baby   in   a   corner .  "    seriously .    i   love   that   line .
799707582	14312	3.5	who   doesn ['] t   love   this   movie ?    no   one   i ['] d   want   to   know .  .  .
799707582	2430	4.0	more   horror   than   sci - fi .    it ['] s   brilliantly   played   out   and   intense   all   the   way   through .    intense   enough   to   make   me   swear   off   natural   birth .    if   i   ever   become   maternal ,    adoption   is   a   great   choice .    also ,    does   ian   holm   always   show   up   in   great   films ?    he ['] s   like   the   spanish   inquisition ,    you   never   expect   him ,    then   there   he   is ,    trying   to   kill   you   and   spitting   up   milk   and   noodles .

799707582	4306	3.5	yes ,    it   did   pave   the   way   for   a   slew   of   painfully   forced   twist   ending   flicks ,    but   this   is   still   a   great   movie ,    beautifully   shot ,    and   featuring   a   child   actor   who   doesn ['] t   act   like   a   child   actor .    bonus   points   for   featuring   toni   collette   and   a   wahlberg .

577374627	11077	3.0	i   like   ben   stiller ,    but   as   adam   sandler ,    this   is   another   actor   that   seems   to   be   repeting   the   same   characterization   in   every   film .    he   is   always   the   nice   looser   that   gets   in   trouble   all   the   time   and   figures   out   how   to   win   each   time .

577374627	13610	3.0	not   so   well   done   fxs .    the   spiderman   seemed   a   little   fake   on   some   shots .    pretty   good   story ,    but   it   needed   more   bad   guys .  .  . and   more   film .

577374627	6287	2.0	the   most   memorable   thing   about   this   one   is   the   theme   while   the   bitch   is   changing   her   clothes .    the   rest   is   history .
577374627	758	1.0	i   really ,    really   hate   lindsey   lohan .    she   is   cute ,    but   dumb   as   hell .

784843257	1518	3.0	i   like   it   at   the   time .

784843257	2908	3.5	i   loved   this   movie .
814008273	1220	5.0	probably   the   best   revenge   movie   of   all   time .       i   understand   that   dakota   fanning   might   be   annoying   to   some   people ,    but   if   she   annoys   you   in   this   film ,    you   are   a   ruthless   piece   of   crap .       denzel   delivers   as   usual .       i   dunno ,    maybe   i   was   feeling   overly   sappy   at   the   viewing ,    but   this   movie   really   grabs   at   your   soul   and   twists   it   until   it   bleeds .
814008273	2372	3.0	the   car   chases   were   too   long ? i   lost   interest   a   little .       constant   stimulation   needed .
814008273	6037	3.0	so   close   to   4   stars   for   me   but   i   couldn ? t   do   it   solely   based   on   matt   damon .       it ? s   good ,    but   not   nearly   as   good   as   i   expected .       i   was   kind   of   bored   at   some   points   which   didn ? t   make   sense   since   it ? s   supposed   to   be   such   a   glossy ,    action   packed ,    gun   shooting ,    bad   guy   killing   movie .
814008273	15105	5.0	adorable   family   movie   one   could   use   as   a   tool   to   discuss   death   with   the   youngens .    vada   sultenfuss ,    so   unforgettable .    i   like   it   when   the   kids   curse
814008273	15107	4.0	ahh ? eye   candy   for   the   movie   go - er   and   a   heist   to   beat   vegas .       this   is   why   people   like   movies .       needs   no   further   explanation .
814008273	886	5.0	i   have   no   idea   why   it   took   me   so   long   to   see   this   movie ;    i   am   ridiculously   impressed   by   jamie   foxx   and   the   story   of   ray   charles .       it   makes   an   excellent   film ? and   then   you   realize   it ? s   a   true   story   and   you ? ll   be   even   more   touched .
814008273	12071	5.0	i   don ['] t   care   what   the   reviewers   say ;    this   movie   kicks   ass .       fly   fatass ,    fly !       and   the   director ['] s   commentary   is   hilarious ,    too .       jay    &    silent   bob   are   so   funny   they   could   cure   cancer .       wait ,    what ?
814008273	16707	4.0	i   don ? t   know   what ? s   funnier ? the   recruiting   process / hazing   scene   from   this   movie   or   that   grandma   cane   down   at   3   and   told   me   to   shut   the   hell   up   when   i   was   watching   it .       no   one   is   ever   too   old   to   live   in   a   sorority   house .
814008273	3750	5.0	even   though   my   emotions   couldn ? t   pick   a   choice   between   loving   this   movie   because   it   made   me   laugh   until   it   hurt   or   loving   it   because   it   made   me   cry   like   a   pansy ,    the   terminal   rules .          tom   hanks   is   just   adorable ,    isn ? t   he ?       i ? d   like   to   watch   him   play   a   bad   guy   just   to   see   if   america   could   dislike   his   character .       i   doubt   it .       has   tom   hanks   ever   played   someone   evil ?       wow ,    i   don ? t   think   so .       anyway ,    i   loved   the   terminal   and   watched   it   in   a   vehicle   on   my   lap   top .       i   think   that ? s   quiet   telling .
814008273	2523	4.0	so   cute .       this   little   actress   is   adorable   and   actually   really   good ,    not   annoying   like   most   child   actors .       principal   trunchbull   could   be   scary   for   children ,    however ,    and   watching   this   movie   should   follow   a   discussion   about   how   school   really   isn ? t   like   this .       then   again ,    if   your   child   believes   this   sort   of   thing   could   happen ,    he   or   she   needs   a   little   more   than   a   discussion .       i   enjoy   movies   that   can   be   fun   for   kids   and   adults .
814008273	13433	3.0	if   you   go   into   this   expecting   a   film   starring   martin   lawrence ,    and   your   expectations   are   just   that ,    you   won ? t      be   disappointed .       of   course   it ? s   goofy ,    of   course   it ? s   stupid ,    and   of   course   the   writing   is   awful .       but   it ? s   free   on   demand   right   now ,    so   go   for   it .
814008273	17324	3.0	this   was   okay .       cute   enough   but   only   in   the   movies   do   dudes   like   kevin   james   get   the   chick   like   the   blonde   in   the   film .       and ,    buddha   bar !       love !
814008273	7691	4.0	oh   boy ,    i   really   like   this   movie .    the   kiddies   like   it   too   because   olivia   hussey   has   big   boobs   and   the   dude   who   plays   romeo   looks   like   zac   efron .    i   like   it   because   i   like   anything   that   has   anything   to   do   with   this   shakespearean   tragedy   that   changes   lives   in   my   classroom .
814008273	2385	4.0	some   of   the   acting   is   comical   when   it   shouldn ? t   be ,    the   plot   is   predictable ,    and   there   are   scenes   that   drag ,    but   i ? m   really   a   sucker   for   these   dancing   flicks .    the   ballet ,    the   choreography ,    the   music :    awesome .
814008273	3966	4.0	football   fans   will   really   like   this   movie .       based   on   a   real   team ? the   1988   odessa   panthers ? and   follows   the   book   pretty   closely .       good   extras   on   the   dvd   like   interviews   with   the   actual   team   members .
814008273	15393	4.0	adam   sandler   is   sometimes   a   little   much   for   me ,    but   i   really   like   this   movie .       it ? s   funny   and   cute .
814008273	331	5.0	love   it !       one   of   my   all   time   favorites .       says   so   much   about   love ,    friendship   and   humanity -  - with   jay    &    silent   bob ,    dick   jokes   and   raunchy   sex   humor .       like   all   smith   flicks ,    the   dvd   extras   are   worth   the   buy .       i   just   need   affleck   to   lose   the   facial   hair .       plus ,    and   i   hate   to   say   it ,    but   joey   lauren   adams [']    voice   is   uber   annoying ,    even   if   she   is   cute .
814008273	12471	4.0	regardless   of   what   you   think   about   marshall   mathers ,    this   is   a   great   movie .       the   rap   battles   are   awesome .       i ? ve   seen   them   before   on   that   stupid   show   on   mtv    ( i   don ? t   remember   the   name   of   it )    and   i   was   unimpressed ;    it   shows   that   no   one   rhymes   quite   like   eminem .       the   story   is   good   too ? you   know ,    a   coming - of - age   root   for   the   underdog   kind   of   thing .       even   people   who   aren ? t   into   rap   would   like   this   movie .       my   grandfather   liked   it .
814008273	5309	4.0	okay ,    i   really   liked   this !       it ? s   a   romantic   comedy   classic -  - a   girly   movie   you   must   watch   with   your   friends .
814008273	329	5.0	i   am   so   biased   over   a   kevin   smith   flick ,    but   this   is   a   great   movie .       not   only   does   it   bless   you   with   damon   and   affleck ['] s   presence ,    but   it   also   makes   you   question   your   religious   beliefs .       heehee ,    i   wish   i   was   related   to   all   of   them .
814008273	9800	3.0	i   like   this   movie   but   there ? s   something   dishonorable   about   gwyneth   paltrow   in   a   fat   suit   to   prove   a   point .       plus ,    i   hate   jack   black .    bad .       other   than   that   it   had   the   potential   to   be   really   good .
814008273	8904	5.0	love .       love .       love .       beautifully   written   and   acted .       a   story   about   friendship ,    loss ,    grief ,    bonding ,    love ,    fear   of   love ,     -  -    i   could   go   on   and   on   and   on .       this   is   my   all - time   favorite   movie .  .  . and   not   just   because   of   the   uhm .  .  . aesthetics .       i   never   get   tired   of   watching   it   because   it ['] s   just   so   fucking   touching .       ps :       casey   affleck   as   morgan = genius .
814008273	788	4.0	ah ,    jay   and   silent   bob .       i   used   to   watch   this   movie   on   repeat   in   college -  - even   met   kevin   smith   and   jason   mewes   once !       this   movie   has   some   of   the   best   dialogue   in   all   conversation .       loved   to   be   a   friend   of   jay ['] s .  .  . purely   for   entertainment   value .       and   the   director ['] s   commentary   is   good   too ,    per   usual .
814008273	3730	4.0	beautiful   film .    i ? m   told   this   movie   is   not   historically   accurate ,    but   i   refuse   to   believe   it   happened   any   other   way   because   the   story   is   fascinating .       we   think   of   elizabeth   i   as   a   monarch ? this   movie   shows   the   elizabeth   pre - queen   and   early   queen   before   she   made   herself   look   like   an   albino .        ( which   i   really   don ? t   understand ,    btw ?  )       i   vaguely   remember   learning   about   this   time   period   in   school   and   it   seemed   drab   which   is   why ,    even   though   people   are   saying   it ? s   false ,    i   refuse   to   believe   the   love   lost ,    the   betrayal   and   the   rise   of   such   an   icon   had   to   have   happened   just   this   way ;    it ? s   what   makes   the   movie   fascinating .       she   was   25   years - old   when   she   took   the   throne .       twenty - five   year   old   women   today   can   barely   take   care   of   themselves    ( myself   included )  ,    nevermind   run   a   country !
814008273	14550	5.0	one   of   my   all - time   favorites .       it ? s   interesting ;    most   of   my   favorite   movies   are   based   on   male   friendship    ( like   good   will   hunting )  .       unforgettable   characters .
814008273	3425	5.0	it ? s   true - i   really   haven ? t   seen   this   movie   until   now .        ( gramp   is   like ,     ? what   kind   of   italian   are   you ?  ?    heh .  )       it   is   the   perfect   gangster   movie   and   has   all   the   components   viewers   seek   when   they   want   to   get   lost   in   a   mob   story .       and   it ? s   based   on   a   real   guy   so   that   makes   it   all   the   more   interesting .       i   have   to   go   though ? time   to   google   henry   hill .
814008273	9254	5.0	i   showed   this   movie   to   a   bunch   of   idiot   thugs   and   they   loved   it .       if   that   doesn ? t   show   that   this   is   a   timeless   movie ,    i   don ? t   know   what   would .       even   though   some   of   the   writing   is   pretty   bad    ( has   steven   spielberg   ever   written   anything   worth   its   weight   in   oscars ?  )    the   overall   movie   is   just   fanfuckingtastic .       especially   chunk .
814008273	3713	5.0	i   had   3   nightmares    ( in   a   row )    after   watching   this .    really ,    really   clever   and   scary   because   there   are   cunning   lunatics   out   there   that   could   actually   think   something   like   this   up .
814008273	6556	4.0	guns ?       drugs ?    a   cross - dressing   mercutio ?       only   baz   luhrman    ( sp )    could   make   something   like   this   work .       a   fresh ,    sexy   and   vibrant   version   of   everyone ? s   favorite   star - crossed   lovers   that   caters   to   the   9th   graders   forced   to   read   it .       the   language   is   still   old   english ,    but   spoken   with   american   accents   so   it ? s   easier   to   follow .       things   are   definitely   changed   up   a   bit ? the   balcony   scene   takes   place   in   a   pool ,    there ? s   a   twist   at   the   end .       i   really   like   this   version ? makes   shakespeare   fun ,    pretty   to   look   at ,    and   more   understandable   for   the   kiddies .       leonardo   dicaprio   and   claire   danes   are   great ,    but   the   screaming   is   a   little   much   at   times .       very   aesthetically   pleasing ? from   the   actors   to   the   costumes   to   the   location   to   the   candles .
814008273	5088	4.0	corny ?    yes ,    but   classic .       you   can ? t   hear   johnny   castle   proclaim   that    ? no   one   puts   baby   in   the   corner ?    without   reminiscing   your   youth   if   you ? re   an   80 ? s   child .       i   wasn ? t   allowed   to   watch   this   movie   as   a   kid   which   made   it   even   more   appealing .       watching   it   as   an   adult   was   surreal ? i   had   no   idea   that   chick   had   an   abortion !       blasphemy !
814008273	1073	4.0	these   movies   will   always   get   me .       coach   carter   is   yet   another   true   inspiring   story   where   one   person   changes   many   lives .       very   moving   and   powerful ,    has   a      strong   message   about   public   education   in   urban   areas ,    and   is   a   great   movie   to   show   student   athletes .       also ,    basketball   is   my   least   favorite   sport   to   watch   yet   i   was   at   the   edge   of   the   couch   watching   the   games .       very   exciting .
814008273	7233	4.0	one   of   my   all   time   favorite   movie   quotes   are   from   this   movie :     ? i ? ve   never   had   friends   like   i   did   when   i   was   twelve .       jesus ,    does   anyone ?  ?       this   movie   is   about   coming   of   age   and   friendship    ?    all   wrapped   into   a   summer   that   changes   your   life    ( similar   to   now   and   then   which   could   be   considered   the   girl   version   of   stand   by   me .       the   young   actors   are   great   and   while   there   are   some   funny   moments ,    there   are   also   endearing   ones .
814008273	13471	5.0	i   don ['] t   care   what   anyone   says .  .  . i   love   this   movie .       it ['] s   super   sweet   and   ben   and   that   little   girl   raquel   castro   or   something   like   that   are   just   adorable   together .       i   want   ben   affleck   to   be   the   godfather   of   one   of   my   children .       he ['] s   so   cute ;    this   is   a   really   sweet   movie .

374696730	9685	4.5	yes ,    it ['] s   a   comedy   but   there   is   a   worthwhile   story   with   characters   who   are   recognisable   as   people   we   probably   know   with   similar   problems .       again ,    many   of   my   favourite   actors   are   here   in   this   movie .
374696730	3524	4.0	i   can   understand   why   this   became   a   cult   favourite .       great   cast   of   actors   who   say    " fuck "    a   total   of   265   times .  .  .  .  . lots   of   dark   humour .
374696730	8976	4.0	there   are   just   so   many   wonderful   lines   in   this   movie   and   james   stewart   plays   elwood   to   perfection .       if   you   enjoy   classic   comedy   then   this   is   a    " must   see "  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

786753488	6099	5.0	premiered   on   the   day   i   was   born !       the   best   metaphysical   action   war   movie   ever .       every   frame   is   mad   and   utterly   brilliant .
786753488	14691	0.5	oh   how   i   wish   this   movie   had   not   been   made .       if   only   for   its   imitators   existences   would   be      condemned   to   hell .       for   it ['] s   sheer   awfulness ,    i   hope   it   suffers   forever .
786753488	12870	0.5	emotional   pornography ,    david   mamet   called   it ,    and   he   is   right .       this   sentimentalises   the   holocaust .       the   tricks   spielberg   uses   to   evoke   emotion   are   manipulative ,    weak   and   sometimes   downright   offensive .       if   you   want   to   learn   about   the   holocaust   go   watch   shoah .
786753488	10042	3.5	a   lot   of   fun .       some   good ,    exciting   setpieces   and   some   good   comedy .       slightly   over   the   top   ending .
786753488	1905	1.0	an   empty   spectacle .       the   sort   of   thing   hollywood   does   frequently   these   days .       nothing   special .
786753488	3938	1.0	more   of   the   same   rubbish .       why   do   they   bother ?       because   they   make   millions ,    i   know .       why   do   i   bother ?       because   i   keep   hoping   that   one   day ,    a   hollywood   screenwriter   will   learn   how   to   tell   a   decent   story   in   the   blockbuster   form .
786753488	9628	3.0	probably   the   weakest   of   the   first   trilogy .       the   ewoks   were   cute .       it   is   a   film   with   a   few   structural   problems   in   the   script .
786753488	13610	1.0	hollywood   spectacle .       trash .
786753488	4867	1.5	not   a   very   good   sequel   to   a   not   very   good   film .
786753488	12778	0.5	i   really   loathe   this   film .       offensive ,    is   one   word   i ['] d   use   against   it .       shit   is   another .       why   this   is   beloved   i   do   not   know .       there   are   many   reasons   i   could   give   why   i   do   not   like   it ,    but   flixter   restricts   the   word   count .
786753488	7664	1.0	spectacle   of   the   hollowest   kind .       manipulative ,    weak   story ,    bad   acting ,    quite   good   design   and   fx .       nothing   else   to   recommend .
786753488	17324	1.0	will   smith   trying   to   be   cary   grant   and   failing .       some   purile   humour   that   didn ['] t   work .       cliched .       just   no .
786753488	3966	1.5	an   average   american   sports   drama    -    we ['] ve   seen   it   all   before .
786753488	16954	3.5	a   lot   of   fun .       sean   connery   was   a   good   addition   to   the   cast .       they ['] re   all   a   little   interchangeable   as   films ,    though ,    aren ['] t   they ?
786753488	16008	2.0	a   very   minor   80s   classic ,    that   even   in   my   childhood   eyes   seemed   weak .
786753488	10358	0.5	i   had   to   walk   out   half   way   through .       i   found   it   far   too   smug .
786753488	1406	0.5	what   was   spielberg   thinking ?       what   was   i   thinking   going   to   see   it ?       rubbish ,    rubbish ,    rubbish .       howard   the   duck ['] s   better !
786753488	6400	1.5	a   playful   littler   movie   from   spielberg ,    and   shows   what   he   can   do   when   he   doesn ['] t   take   himself   serious .       a   breezy   set   of   opening   titles   too .       tries   a   little   too   much   at   the   end ,    if   i   remember ,    of   putting   frank   abagnale   into    ['] history [']  .       he   was   a   con   artist ,    nothing   more .
786753488	3195	1.0	apart   from   the   first   twenty   minutes   this   has   nothing   to   recommend   it ,    and   the   first   twenty   minutes   are   manipulative   in   the    ['] best [']     ( read   worst )    spielbergian   ways .
786753488	4043	2.0	some   good   scares   in   an   otherwise   patchy   movie .       the   ending   is   preposterous .       aliens   with   an   allergy   to   water   invading   a   planet   made   of   water    -    come   on !       think   night ,    think !
786753488	5191	0.5	a   very   very   poor   movie   with   terrible   acting ,    script   and   direction .       the   best   thing   in   it   is   the   mountain   photography ,    and   that   you   can   google   and   look   at .       don ['] t   ever   bother .       unless   you ['] re   a   fan   or   torture .       or   the   director ['] s   mum    ( and   if   you   are ,    i ['] m   so   sorry   for   you .  )
786753488	8174	1.5	a   chilling   portrait   of   alienated   american   youth    ( yet   again )  ,    but   this   one   is   weaker   than   most   and   is   full   of   larry   clark ['] s   dubious   tastes .
786753488	6287	1.0	just   not   my   cup   of   tea .       some   funny   lines ,    though .
786753488	6274	2.0	a   thriller   that   has   its   moments .
786753488	1518	1.0	not   a   bad   kids   film .       christina   ricci   was   very   good .       the   effects   were   fun .
786753488	11781	2.0	the   weakest   of   this   trilogy ,    it   nevertheless   has   some   fun   little   moments .       the   introduction   of   the   kid   was   such   a   big   mistake .       shame .
786753488	2689	1.5	some   of   the   effects   were   stunning ,    but   the   film   itself   feels   about   half   an   hour   to   long .       it   has   a   natural   ending   about   three   quarters   of   the   way   in ,    and   an   ending   that   would   have   been   deeply   shocking ,    but   then   spielberg   just   carries   on ,    adding   sentiment ,    and   unneccesary   plot   twists .       such   a   waste ,    as   the   first   half   was   really   quite   interesting .
786753488	7643	1.5	one   of   the   worst   examples   of   speilberg   trying   to   be    ['] important [']    to   cinema .    it ['] s   rescued   only   by   a   charismatic   performance   by   a   young   christian   bale .
786753488	14869	3.0	a   good   dystopian   science   fiction   movie   that   i   feel   is   somewhat   overrated .
786753488	6497	0.5	obvious   thriller   in   the   usual   mould .       aren ['] t   we   bored   of   these   by   now ?
786753488	3463	1.5	one   of   the   better   teen   comedies .       julia   stiles   is   very   good ,    and   heath   ledger   shows   promise .       there   are   some   witty   one   liners ,    and   it   has   a   certain   flair .       not   bad .
786753488	8079	2.0	occassionally   hammy ,    occassionally   quite   interesting .       there   are   better   vampire   movies .
786753488	4805	1.5	some   good   lines   found   amongst   some   very   bad   ones .       performances   that   were   all   over   the   place .
786753488	5430	3.0	a   very   powerful ,    emotive   drama ,    based   on   lorenzo   carcaterra ['] s   book .       some   overloaded   catholic   imagery   at   times ,    but   a   movie   full   of   good   turns .       not   an   easy   watch ,    mind .
786753488	3750	0.5	this   was   a   terrible   film .       tom   hanks   did   such   a   terrible   accent ,    and   the   story    -    even   though   its   based   on   a   true   one    -    seemed   unlikely ,    and   stretched   beyond   credibility .       i   was   so   glad   when   this   one   was   over .
786753488	11337	0.5	purile   nonsense   that   was   dated   when   porky ['] s   did   it   twenty   years   ago .
786753488	4698	1.0	a   very   poor   sequel .       though   it   has   some   good   moments   of   tension    -    well   one    ( the   glass   shattering   beneath   their   feet   over   a   cliff )     -    the   rest   of   it   is   just   so   nonsensical .       bad .
786753488	9543	3.0	a   times   an   exciting   science   fiction   movie   that   sometimes   descends   into   mawkishness   and   overt   grand   standing   that   diminish   its   power .       this   is   not   an   important   film ,    why   try   and   pretend   it   is ?
786753488	5522	3.0	a   very   interesting ,    if   predictable ,    thriller .       bale ['] s   performance   was   electric .
786753488	11013	1.5	was   a   garbled   mess ,    if   i   recall .       i   don ['] t   think   i ['] ve   liked   a   verbinski   film   yet    -    sorry   gore .
786753488	5112	1.0	one   or   two   effective   moments ,    the   rest   was   pure   rip - off   from   other ,    better   thrillers .
786753488	8989	1.0	julia   stiles   still   showing   promise .       the   rest   was   pure   cliche .
786753488	14482	2.5	i   quite   enjoyed   it .       la   jetee ,    of   which   this   is   a   remake ,    is   better .       some   good   effects .
786753488	16969	1.0	attempted   for   mysterious ,    didn ['] t   achieve   it .       swayze   is   quite   good   though .
786753488	12102	3.5	very   funny ,    good   performances .       an   enjoyable   little   film .
786753488	13651	1.5	a   few   tense   moments ,    some   very   ludicrous   thrills .             i   kinda   enjoyed   it   in   a   hokey   way .
786753488	6482	2.5	not   as   good   as   critters .       sorry .
786753488	14882	2.5	some   good   thrills   in   an   otherwise   mediocre   film .
786753488	6615	0.5	how   much   did   they   want   oscars   for   this ?       every   shot   was   the   actors   and   director   on   their   knees   begging   for   one .       it   made   me   vomit .
786753488	14312	4.0	probably   spielberg ['] s   best   popcorn   movie .       there   is   a   lot   to   admire   here ,    and   for   once   he   is   unusually   restrained   on   the   sentiment ,    and   even   allows   the   kids   to   be   put   in   mortal   danger .       a   lot   of   fun ,    more   than   it   has   any   right   to   be .
786753488	3860	1.0	bad   jokes ,    bad   acting ,    and   what   was   morgan   freeman   thinking ?
786753488	6886	2.0	an   average ,    not   very   saucy   remake   of   les   enfant   terribles ,    just   updated   to   1968 .       there   was   a   better   movie   to   be   made   about   this   time ,    and   a   better   film   about   forbidden   lust .

527320209	15177	0.5	it   was   entirely   too   contrived   by   this   point
527320209	2743	4.0	it   was   very   good ,    i   was   a   bit   sad   about   the   ending .
527320209	15058	1.0	the   best   part   of   this   movie   was   the   dude   in   his   underwear .  .  .    a   terrible   snoozer !  !  !
527320209	15409	3.0	i   liked   this   movie .    the   dvd   has   some   pretty   cool   special   features .
527320209	2862	4.5	at   one   time   i   thought   this   movie   would   be   too   terrible   to   watch .  .  .    i   was   terribly   mistaken !  !  !
527320209	10168	4.0	i   thought   it   was   very   creative .  .  .    even   if   it   was   made   from   a    " graphic   novel "
527320209	14940	2.5	i   liked   this   more   than   i   thought   i   would .

527320209	7664	4.0	good   movie   but   not   historically   accurate   at   all .

527320209	7745	3.0	much   better   than   i   thought   it   would   be
527320209	8016	4.0	so   i   thought   this   movie   would   be   just   horrible   and   it   turned   out   to   be   a   pretty   good   movie ,    for   the   most   part .    certainly   a   grown   up   film ,    but   i   think   it   wrestled   appropriately   with   the   serious   adult   themes   we   as   adults   deal   with   and   though   the   ending   seemed   rather   artifical   and   contrived   a   few   key   scenes    ( and   not   just   the   ones   with   nicole   kidman   naked )    were   enough   to   keep   this   movie   at   a   4   star   for   me .    i   am   certainly   going   to   visit   other   kubrick   films !
527320209	16286	4.5	anthony   hopkins   and   edward   norton .  .  .    how   could   this   movie   possibly   suck ?

527320209	1105	0.5	i   kept   giving   robocop   a   chance   and   it   failed   me   everytime !  !  !
527320209	28	1.5	best   thing   about   this   was   the   elvis   music   and   my   buddy   trevor ['] s   impression   of   the   stitch

527320209	15922	4.5	parts   of   me   wish   that   i   would   have   seen   this   movie   a   long   time   ago   because   it   seriously   lives   up   to   the   hype   and   then   some .  .  .    but   then   other   parts   remind   those   parts   that   i   wouldn ['] t   probably   have   understood   it   until   now .    great   movie .  .  .    edited   great ,    dennis   hoffman   was   always   the   man ,    and   yeah   real   quarky   60 ['] s   flick .    great .

527320209	13580	2.0	i   probably   need   to   see   it   again ,    but   i   didn ['] t   care   a   whole   lot   for   it .    the   whole   eating   the   goldfish   thing   was   too   much   for   me   at   the   young   ripe   age   i   was   when   i   saw   it .
527320209	6961	2.0	trevor   made   me   watch   this .    the   best   part   was   the   coffee   scene

527320209	4056	1.5	if   they   would   have   stayed   closer   to   the   original   then   it   would   be   hundreds   of   times   better .    at   present ,    it   was   a   cheap   knock - off .

527320209	17387	2.5	this   was   kind   of   racy ,    as   you ['] d   imagine ,    but   it   had   a   good   story .    the   acting   was   okay ,    a   little   difficult   to   get   around   the   overt   sexuality ,    but   it   was   a   good   film   and   explored   an   area   that   isn ['] t   hardly   explored   in   the   mainstream .
527320209	11886	2.0	five   alive !
527320209	2660	2.5	the   scene   where   meg   ryan   was   faking   an   orgasm   was   the   best   part

527320209	16113	1.0	the   only   good   thing   about   this   movie   was   sandra   bullock ,    the   rest   was   crap .

527320209	12838	3.5	this   movie   can   be   summed   up   in   two   words :     " eh ,    ya   f *  * ker !  "

527320209	3611	4.5	i   thought   this   was   an   excellent   movie .
527320209	8636	0.5	should   have   been   called   bra   raider
527320209	5793	4.0	pretty   cool .    kate   beckinsale   is   so   dang   pretty   whether   she   is   killing   warewolves   or   striking   a   pose   i   am   speechless .    decent   story   line   too .

527320209	8832	3.5	i   had   heard   so   much   that   i   should   see   this   movie ,    that   i   would   love ,    love ,    love   it .    it   was   pretty   darn   good ,    i   will   say   that .    but   i   left   with   a   little   to   be   desired .
527320209	2422	3.0	i   didn ['] t   like   it   as   much   as   i   thought   i   would .    acting   was   bad .  .  .    looked   like   something   straight   from   film   school .

527320209	6886	2.5	this   was   an   interesting   movie   that   reminded   me   of    " the   unbearable   lightness   of   being .  "    i   didn ['] t   like   it   as   much   as   some   of   the   others   i   have   seen   recently .    the   difference   between   this   movie   and   the   unbearable   lightness   of   being   for   me ,    well   one   of   them ,    is   that   the   sexuality   in   the   unbearable   ligtness   of   being   was   necessary ,    but   the   sexuality   in   this   seemed   a   bit   much .    instead   of   being   about   the   political   climate   in   paris   it   was   distracted   by   its   sexuality .  .  .    and   film   gurus .    it   was   okay .
